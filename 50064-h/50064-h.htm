<h3>PREFATORY.</h3>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="upper-case">Thoughts,</span> that have tarried in my mind, and peopled its inner chambers,</p>
 <p>The sober children of reason, or desultory train of fancy;</p>
 <p>Clear running wine of conviction, with the scum and the lees of speculation;</p>
 <p>Corn from the sheaves of science, with stubble from mine own garner:</p>
 <p>Searchings after Truth, that have tracked her secret lodes,</p>
 <p>And come up again to the surface-world, with a knowledge grounded deeper;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
 <p>Arguments of high scope, that have soared to the key-stone of heaven,</p>
 <p>And thence have swooped to their certain mark, as the falcon to its quarry;</p>
 <p>The fruits I have gathered of prudence, the ripened harvest of my musings,</p>
 <p>These commend I unto thee, O docile scholar of Wisdom,</p>
 <p>These I give to thy gentle heart, thou lover of the right.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">What,</span> though a guilty man renew that hallowed theme,</p>
 <p>And strike with feebler hand the harp of Sirach's son?</p>
 <p>What, though a youthful tongue take up that ancient parable,</p>
 <p>And utter faintly forth dark sayings as of old?</p>
 <p>Sweet is the virgin honey, though the wild bee have stored it in a reed,</p>
 <p>And bright the jewelled band, that circleth an Ethiop's arm;</p>
 <p>Pure are the grains of gold in the turbid stream of Ganges,</p>
 <p>And fair the living flowers, that spring from the dull cold sod.</p>
 <p>Wherefore, thou gentle student, bend thine ear to my speech,</p>
 <p>For I also am as thou art; our hearts can commune together:</p>
 <p>To meanest matters will I stoop, for mean is the lot of mortal;</p>
 <p>I will rise to noblest themes, for the soul hath an heritage of glory:</p>
 <p>The passions of puny man; the majestic characters of God;</p>
 <p>The feverish shadows of time, and the mighty substance of eternity.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Commend</span> thy mind unto candour, and grudge not as though thou hadst a teacher,</p>
 <p>Nor scorn angelic Truth for the sake of her evil herald;</p>
 <p>Heed not him, but hear his words, and care not whence they come;</p>
 <p>The viewless winds might whisper them, the billows roar them forth,</p>
 <p>The mean unconscious sedge sigh them in the ear of evening,</p>
 <p>Or the mind of pride conceive, and the mouth of folly speak them.</p>
 <p>Lo now, I stand not forth laying hold on spear and buckler,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
 <p>I come a man of peace, to comfort, not to combat;</p>
 <p>With soft persuasive speech to charm thy patient ear,</p>
 <p>Giving the hand of fellowship, acknowledging the heart of sympathy:</p>
 <p>Let us walk together as friends in the shaded paths of meditation,</p>
 <p>Nor Judgment set his seal until he hath poised his balance;</p>
 <p>That the chastenings of mild reproof may meet unwitting error,</p>
 <p>And Charity not be a stranger at the board that is spread for brothers.</p>

<h3>THE WORDS OF WISDOM.</h3>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="upper-case">Few</span> and precious are the words which the lips of Wisdom utter:</p>
 <p>To what shall their rarity be likened? What price shall count their worth?</p>
 <p>Perfect and much to be desired, and giving joy with riches,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
 <p>No lovely thing on earth can picture all their beauty.</p>
 <p>They be chance pearls, flung among the rocks by the sullen waters of Oblivion,</p>
 <p>Which Diligence loveth to gather, and hang around the neck of Memory;</p>
 <p>They be white-winged seeds of happiness, wafted from the islands of the blessed,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
 <p>Which Thought carefully tendeth, in the kindly garden of the heart;</p>
 <p>They be sproutings of an harvest for eternity, bursting through the tilth of time,</p>
 <p>Green promise of the golden wheat, that yieldeth angels' food;</p>
 <p>They be drops of the crystal dew, which the wings of seraphs scatter,</p>
 <p>When on some brighter sabbath, their plumes quiver most with delight:</p>
 <p>Such, and so precious, are the words which the lips of Wisdom utter.</p>
</div>

<div class="image-center">
  <img width="225" height="230" alt="" src="images/image07ar.jpg" />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Yet</span> more, for the half is not said, of their might, and dignity, and value;</p>
 <p>For life-giving be they and glorious, redolent of sanctity and heaven:</p>
 <p>As fumes of hallowed incense, that veil the throne of the Most High;</p>
 <p>As beaded bubbles that sparkle on the rim of the cup of immortality;</p>
 <p>As wreaths of the rainbow spray, from the pure cataracts of truth:</p>
 <p>Such, and so precious, are the words which the lips of Wisdom utter.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Yet</span> once again, loving student, suffer the praises of thy teacher,</p>
 <p>For verily the sun of the mind, and the life of the heart is Wisdom:</p>
 <p>She is pure and full of light, crowning grey hairs with lustre,</p>
 <p>And kindling the eye of youth with a fire not its own;</p>
 <p>And her words, whereunto canst thou liken them? for earth cannot show their peers:</p>
 <p>They be grains of the diamond sand, the radiant floor of heaven,</p>
 <p>Rising in sunny dust behind the chariot of God;</p>
 <p>They be flashes of the dayspring from on high, shed from the windows of the skies;</p>
 <p>They be streams of living waters, fresh from the fountain of Intelligence:</p>
 <p>Such, and so precious, are the words which the lips of Wisdom utter.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">For</span> these shall guide thee well, and guard thee on thy way;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
 <p>And wanting all beside, with these shalt thou be rich:</p>
 <p>Though all around be woe, these shall make thee happy;</p>
 <p>Though all within be pain, these shall bring thee health:</p>
 <p>Thy good shall grow into ripeness, thine evil wither and decay,</p>
 <p>And Wisdom's words shall sweetly charm thy doubtful into virtues:</p>
 <p>Meanness shall then be frugal care; where shame was, thou art modest;</p>
 <p>Cowardice riseth into caution, rashness is sobered into courage;</p>
 <p>The wrathful spirit, rendering a reason, standeth justified in anger;</p>
 <p>The idle hand hath fair excuse, propping the thoughtful forehead.</p>
 <p>Life shall have no labyrinth but thy steps can track it,</p>
 <p>For thou hast a silken clue, to lead thee through the darkness:</p>
 <p>The rampant Minotaur of ignorance shall perish at thy coming,</p>
 <p>And thine enfranchised fellows hail thy white victorious sails.</p>
 <p>Wherefore, friend and scholar, hear the words of Wisdom;</p>
 <p>Whether she speaketh to thy soul in the full chords of revelation;</p>
 <p>In the teaching earth, or air, or sea; in the still melodies of thought;</p>
 <p>Or, haply, in the humbler strains that would detain thee here.</p>

<h3>OF TRUTH IN THINGS FALSE.</h3>

<div class="image-left">
  <img width="72" height="147" alt="" src="images/image08cr.jpg" />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Error</span>
 is a hardy plant; it flourisheth in every soil;</p>
 <p>In the heart of the wise and good, alike with the wicked and foolish.</p>
 <p>For there is no error so crooked, but it hath in it some lines of truth:</p>
 <p>Nor is any poison so deadly, that it serveth not some wholesome use:</p>
 <p>And the just man, enamoured of the right, is blinded by the speciousness of wrong;</p>
 <p>And the prudent, perceiving an advantage, is content to overlook the harm.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
 <p>On all things created remaineth the half-effaced signature of God,</p>
 <p>Somewhat of fair and good, though blotted by the finger of corruption:</p>
 <p>And if error cometh in like a flood, it mixeth with streams of truth;</p>
 <p>And the Adversary loveth to have it so, for thereby many are decoyed.</p>
 <p>Providence is dark in its permissions; yet one day, when all is known,</p>
 <p>The universe of reason shall acknowledge how just and good were they;</p>
 <p>For the wise man leaneth on his wisdom, and the righteous trusteth to his righteousness,</p>
 <p>And those, who thirst for independence, are suffered to drink of disappointment.</p>
 <p>Wherefore?&mdash;to prove and humble them; and to teach the idolaters of Truth,</p>
 <p>That it is but the ladder unto Him, on whom only they should trust.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">There</span> is truth in the wildest scheme that imaginative heat hath engendered,</p>
 <p>And a man may gather somewhat from the crudest theories of fancy:</p>
 <p>The alchymist laboureth in folly, but catcheth chance gleams of wisdom,</p>
 <p>And findeth out many inventions, though his crucible breed not gold;</p>
 <p>The sinner, toying with witchcraft, thinketh to delude his fellows,</p>
 <p>But there be very spirits of evil, and what if they come at his bidding?</p>
 <p>He is a bold bad man who dareth to tamper with the dead;</p>
 <p>For their whereabout lieth in a mystery&mdash;that vestibule leading to Eternity,</p>
 <p>The waiting-room for unclad ghosts, before the presence-chamber of their King:</p>
 <p>Mind may act upon mind, though bodies be far divided;</p>
 <p>For the life is in the blood, but souls communicate unseen:</p>
 <p>And the heat of an excited intellect, radiating to its fellows,</p>
 <p>Doth kindle dry leaves afar off, while the green wood around it is unwarmed.</p>
 <p>The dog may have a spirit, as well as his brutal master;</p>
 <p>A spirit to live in happiness: for why should he be robbed of his existence?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
 <p>Hath he not a conscience of evil, a glimmer of moral sense,</p>
 <p>Love and hatred, courage and fear, and visible shame and pride?</p>
 <p>There may be a future rest for the patient victims of the cruel;</p>
 <p>And a season allotted for their bliss, to compensate for unjust suffering.</p>
 <p>Spurn not at seeming error, but dig below its surface for the truth;</p>
 <p>And beware of seeming truths, that grow on the roots of error:</p>
 <p>For comely are the apples that spring from the Dead Sea's cursed shore,</p>
 <p>But within are they dust and ashes, and the hand that plucked them shall rue it.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">A frequent</span> similar effect argueth a constant cause:</p>
 <p>Yet who hath counted the links that bind an omen to its issue?</p>
 <p>Who hath expounded the law that rendereth calamities gregarious,</p>
 <p>Pressing down with yet more woes the heavy-laden mourner?</p>
 <p>Who knoweth wherefore a monsoon should swell the sails of the prosperous,</p>
 <p>Blithely speeding on their course the children of good luck?</p>
 <p>Who hath companied a vision from the horn or ivory gate?</p>
 <p>Or met another's mind in his, and explained its presence?</p>
 <p>There is a secret somewhat in antipathies; and love is more than fancy;</p>
 <p>Yea, and a palpable notice warneth of an instant danger;</p>
 <p>For the soul hath its feelers, cobwebs floating on the wind,</p>
 <p>That catch events in their approach with sure and apt presentiment;</p>
 <p>So that some halo of attraction heraldeth a coming friend,</p>
 <p>Investing in his likeness the stranger that passed on before;</p>
 <p>And while the word is in thy mouth, behold thy word fulfilled,</p>
 <p>And he of whom we spake can answer for himself.</p>
 <p>O man, little hast thou learnt of truth in things most true,</p>
 <p>How therefore shall thy blindness wot of truth in things most false?</p>
 <p>Thou hast not yet perceived the causes of life or motion,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
 <p>How then canst thou define the subtle sympathies of mind?</p>
 <p>For the spirit, sharpest and strongest when disease hath rent the body,</p>
 <p>Hath welcomed kindred spirits in nightly visitations,</p>
 <p>Or learnt from restless ghosts dark secrets of the living,</p>
 <p>And helped slow justice to her prey by the dreadful teaching of a dream.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Verily,</span> there is nothing so true, that the damps of error have not warped it;</p>
 <p>Verily, there is nothing so false, that a sparkle of truth is not in it.</p>
 <p>For the enemy, the father of lies, the giant Upas of creation,</p>
 <p>Whose deadly shade hath blasted this once green garden of the Lord,</p>
 <p>Can but pervert the good, but may not create the evil;</p>
 <p>He destroyeth, but cannot build; for he is not antagonist deity:</p>
 <p>Mighty is his stolen power, yet is he a creature and a subject;</p>
 <p>Not a maker of abstract wrong, but a spoiler of concrete right:</p>
 <p>The fiend hath not a royal crown; he is but a prowling robber,</p>
 <p>Suffered, for some mysterious end, to haunt the King's highway;</p>
 <p>And the keen sword he beareth, once was a simple ploughshare;</p>
 <p>Yea, and his panoply of error is but a distortion of the truth:</p>
 <p>The sickle that once reaped righteousness, beaten from its useful curve,</p>
 <p>With axe, and spike, and bar, headeth the marauder's halbert.</p>
 <p>Seek not further, O man, to solve the dark riddle of sin;</p>
 <p>Suffice it, that thine own bad heart is to thee thine origin of evil.</p>

<h3>OF ANTICIPATION.</h3>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="upper-case">Thou</span> hast seen many sorrows, travel-stained pilgrim of the world,</p>
 <p>But that which hath vexed thee most hath been the looking for evil;</p>
 <p>And though calamities have crossed thee, and misery been heaped on thy head,</p>
 <p>Yet ills, that never happened, have chiefly made thee wretched.</p>
 <p>The sting of pain and the edge of pleasure are blunted by long expectation,</p>
 <p>For the gall and the balm alike are diluted in the waters of patience:</p>
 <p>And often thou sippest sweetness, ere the cup is dashed from thy lip;</p>
 <p>Or drainest the gall of fear, while evil is passing by thy dwelling.</p>
 <p>A man too careful of danger liveth in continual torment,</p>
 <p>But a cheerful expecter of the best hath a fountain of joy within him:</p>
 <p>Yea, though the breath of disappointment should chill the sanguine heart,</p>
 <p>Speedily gloweth it again, warmed by the live embers of hope;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
 <p>Though the black and heavy surge close above the head for a moment,</p>
 <p>Yet the happy buoyancy of Confidence riseth superior to Despair.</p>
 <p>Verily, evils may be courted, may be wooed and won by distrust:</p>
 <p>For the wise Physician of our weal loveth not an unbelieving spirit;</p>
 <p>And to those giveth He good, who rely on His hand for good;</p>
 <p>And those leaveth He to evil, who fear, but trust Him not.</p>
 <p>Ask for good, and hope it, for the ocean of good is fathomless;</p>
 <p>Ask for good, and have it, for thy Friend would see thee happy;</p>
 <p>But to the timid heart, to the child of unbelief and dread,</p>
 <p>That leaneth on his own weak staff, and trusteth the sight of his eyes,</p>
 <p>The evil he feared shall come, for the soil is ready for the seed,</p>
 <p>And suspicion hath coldly put aside the hand that was ready to help him.</p>
 <p>Therefore look up, sad spirit; be strong, thou coward heart,</p>
 <p>Or fear will make thee wretched, though evil follow not behind:</p>
 <p>Cease to anticipate misfortune; there are still many chances of escape;</p>
 <p>But if it come, be courageous; face it, and conquer thy calamity.</p>
 <p>There is not an enemy so stout, as to storm and take the fortress of the mind,</p>
 <p>Unless its infirmity turn traitor, and Fear unbar the gates.</p>
 <p>The valiant standeth as a rock, and the billows break upon him;</p>
 <p>The timorous is a skiff unmoored, tost and mocked at by a ripple:</p>
 <p>The valiant holdeth fast to good, till evil wrench it from him;</p>
 <p>The timorous casteth it aside, to meet the worst half way:</p>
 <p>Yet oftentimes is evil but a braggart, that provoketh and will not fight;</p>
 <p>Or the feint of a subtle fencer, who measureth his thrust elsewhere:</p>
 <p>Or perchance a blessing in a masque, sent to try thy trust,</p>
 <p>The precious smiting of a friend, whose frowns are all in love:</p>
 <p>Often the storm threateneth, but is driven to other climes,</p>
 <p>And the weak hath quailed in fear, while the firm hath been glad in his confidence.</p>

<h3>OF HIDDEN USES.</h3>

<div class="stanza">
 <p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span>
 sea-wort floating on the waves, or rolled up high along the shore,</p>
 <p>Ye counted useless and vile, heaping on it names of contempt:</p>
 <p>Yet hath it gloriously triumphed, and man been humbled in his ignorance,</p>
 <p>For health is in the freshness of its savour, and it cumbereth the beach with wealth;</p>
 <p>Comforting the tossings of pain with its violet-tinctured essence,</p>
 <p>And by its humbler ashes enriching many proud.</p>
 <p>Be this, then, a lesson to thy soul, that thou reckon nothing worthless,</p>
 <p>Because thou heedest not its use, nor knowest the virtues thereof.</p>
 <p>And herein, as thou walkest by the sea, shall weeds be a type and an earnest</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
 <p>Of the stored and uncounted riches lying hid in all creatures of God:</p>
 <p>There be flowers making glad the desert, and roots fattening the soil,</p>
 <p>And jewels in the secret deep, scattered among groves of coral,</p>
 <p>And comforts to crown all wishes, and aids unto every need,</p>
 <p>Influences yet unthought, and virtues, and many inventions,</p>
 <p>And uses above and around, which man hath not yet regarded.</p>
 <p>Not long to charm away disease hath the crocus yielded up its bulb,</p>
 <p>Nor the willow lent its bark, nor the nightshade its vanquished poison;</p>
 <p>Not long hath the twisted leaf, the fragrant gift of China,</p>
 <p>Nor that nutritious root, the boon of far Peru,</p>
 <p>Nor the many-coloured dahlia, nor the gorgeous flaunting cactus,</p>
 <p>Nor the multitude of fruits and flowers, ministered to life and luxury:</p>
 <p>Even so, there be virtues yet unknown in the wasted foliage of the elm,</p>
 <p>In the sun-dried harebell of the downs, and the hyacinth drinking in the meadow,</p>
 <p>In the sycamore's winged fruit, and the facet-cut cones of the cedar;</p>
 <p>And the pansy and bright geranium live not alone for beauty,</p>
 <p>Nor the waxen flower of the arbute, though it dieth in a day,</p>
 <p>Nor the sculptured crest of the fir, unseen but by the stars;</p>
 <p>And the meanest weed of the garden serveth unto many uses,</p>
 <p>The salt tamarisk, and juicy flag, the freckled orchis, and the daisy.</p>

 is the government of heaven in allotting pleasures among men,</p>
 <p>And just the everlasting law, that hath wedded happiness to virtue:</p>
 <p>For verily on all things else broodeth disappointment with care,</p>
 <p>That childish man may be taught the shallowness of earthly enjoyment.</p>
 <p>Wherefore, ye that have enough, envy ye the rich man his abundance?</p>
 <p>Wherefore, daughters of affluence, covet ye the cottager's content?</p>
 <p>Take the good with the evil, for ye all are pensioners of God,</p>
 <p>And none may choose or refuse the cup His wisdom mixeth.</p>
 <p>The poor man rejoiceth at his toil, and his daily bread is sweet to him:</p>
 <p>Content with present good, he looketh not for evil to the future:</p>
 <p>The rich man languisheth with sloth, and findeth pleasure in nothing,</p>
 <p>He locketh up care with his gold, and feareth the fickleness of fortune.</p>
 <p>Can a cup contain within itself the measure of a bucket?</p>
 <p>Or the straitened appetites of man drink more than their fill of luxury?</p>
 <p>There is a limit to enjoyment, though the sources of wealth be boundless:</p>
 <p>And the choicest pleasures of life lie within the ring of moderation.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Also,</span> though penury and pain be real and bitter evils,</p>
 <p>I would reason with the poor afflicted, for he is not so wretched as he seemeth.</p>
 <p>What right hath an offender to complain, though others escape punishment,</p>
 <p>If the stripes of earned misfortune overtake him in his sin?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
 <p>Wherefore not endure with resignation the evils thou canst not avert?</p>
 <p>For the coward pain will flee, if thou meet him as a man:</p>
 <p>Consider, whatever be thy fate, that it might and ought to have been worse,</p>
 <p>And that it lieth in thy hand to gather even blessing from afflictions:</p>
 <p>Bethink thee, wherefore were they sent? and hath not use blunted their keenness?</p>
 <p>Need hope, and patience, and courage, be strangers to the meanest hovel?</p>
 <p>Thou art in an evil case, it were cruel to deny to thee compassion,</p>
 <p>But there is not unmitigated ill in the sharpest of this world's sorrows:</p>
 <p>I touch not the sore of thy guilt; but of human griefs I counsel thee,</p>
 <p>Cast off the weakness of regret, and gird thee to redeem thy loss:</p>
 <p>Thou hast gained, in the furnace of affliction, self-knowledge, patience, and humility,</p>
 <p>And these be as precious ore, that waiteth the skill of the coiner:</p>
 <p>Despise not the blessings of adversity, nor the gain thou hast earned so hardly,</p>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Power</span> is seldom innocent, and envy is the yoke-fellow of eminence;</p>

 <p>The poor man counteth not the cost at which such wealth hath been purchased;</p>
 <p>He would be on the mountain's top, without the toil and travail of the climbing.</p>
 <p>But equity demandeth recompense: for high-place, calumny and care;</p>
 <p>For state, comfortless splendour eating out the heart of home;</p>
 <p>For warrior fame, dangers and death; for a name among the learned, a spirit overstrained;</p>
 <p>For honour of all kinds, the goad of ambition; on every acquirement, the tax of anxiety.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
 <p>He that would change with another, must take the cup as it is mixed:</p>
 <p>Poverty, with largeness of heart; or a full purse, with a sordid spirit;</p>
 <p>Wisdom, in an ailing body; or a common mind, with health:</p>
 <p>Godliness, with man's scorn; or the welcome of the mighty, with guilt:</p>
 <p>Beauty, with a fickle heart; or plainness of face, with affection.</p>
 <p>For so hath Providence determined, that a man shall not easily discover</p>
 <p>Unmingled good or evil, to quicken his envy or abhorrence.</p>
 <p>A bold man or a fool must he be, who would change his lot with another;</p>
 <p>It were a fearful bargain, and mercy hath lovingly refused it:</p>
 <p>For we know the worst of ourselves, but the secrets of another we see not,</p>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Just,</span> and strong, and opportune is the moral rule of God;</p>

 <p>Nor heed the compensating peace, which gladdeneth the good in his afflictions.</p>
 <p>They see not the frightful dreams that crowd a bad man's pillow,</p>
 <p>Like wreathed adders crawling round his midnight conscience;</p>
 <p>They hear not the terrible suggestions, that knock at the portal of his will,</p>
 <p>Provoking to wipe away from life the one weak witness of the deed;</p>
 <p>They know not the torturing suspicions that sting his panting breast,</p>
 <p>When the clear eye of penetration quietly readeth off the truth.</p>
 <p>Likewise of the good what know they? The memories bringing pleasure,</p>
 <p>Shrined in the heart of the benevolent, and glistening from his eye;</p>
 <p>The calm self-justifying reason that establisheth the upright in his purpose;</p>
 <p>The warm and gushing bliss that floodeth all the thoughts of the religious.</p>
 <p>Many a beggar at the cross-way, or grey-haired shepherd on the plain,</p>
 <p>Hath more of the end of all wealth, than hundreds who multiply the means.</p>

 <p>And yet he may know nothing of the cause that maketh thee distasteful to his soul,&mdash;</p>
 <p>The cause of unkind suspicion, for which thou hast thy punishment:</p>
 <p>And if thou think of him in charity, wishing or praying for his weal,</p>
 <p>He shall not guess the secret charm that lureth his soul to love thee.</p>
 <p>For just is retributive ubiquity: Samson did sin with Dalilah,</p>
 <p>And his eyes and captive strength were forfeit to the Philistine:</p>
 <p>Jacob robbed his brother, and sorrow was his portion to the grave:</p>
 <p>David must fly before his foes, yea, though his guilt is covered:</p>
 <p>And He who, seeming old in youth, was marred for others' sin,</p>
 <p>For every special crime must bear its special penalty:</p>
 <p>By luxury, or rashness, or vice, the member that hath erred suffereth,&mdash;</p>

 <p>There is a joy in sorrow, which none but a mourner can know:</p>
 <p>Madness hath imaginary bliss, and most men have no more;</p>
 <p>Age hath its quiet calm, and youth enjoyeth not for haste:</p>
 <p>Daily, in the midst of its beatitude, the righteous soul is vexed;</p>
 <p>And even the misery of guilt doth attain to the bliss of pardon.</p>
 <p>Who, in the face of the born-blind, ever looked on other than content?</p>
 <p>And the deaf ear listeneth within to the silent music of the heart.</p>
 <p>There is evil poured upon the earth from the overflowings of corruption,&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
 <p>Sickness, and poverty, and pain, and guilt, and madness, and sorrow;</p>
 <p>But, as the water from a fountain riseth and sinketh to its level,</p>
 <p>Ceaselessly toileth justice to equalize the lots of men:</p>
 <p>For, habit and hope and ignorance, and the being but one of a multitude,</p>
 <p>And strength of reason in the sage, and dulness of feeling in the fool,</p>
 <p>And the light elasticity of courage, and the calm resignation of meekness,</p>
 <p>And the stout endurance of decision, and the weak carelessness of apathy,</p>
 <p>And helps invisible but real, and ministerings not unfelt,</p>
 <p>Angelic aid with worldly discomfiture, bodily loss with the soul's gain,</p>
 <p>Secret griefs, and silent joys, thorns in the flesh, and cordials for the spirit,</p>
 (&mdash;Short of the insuperable barrier dividing innocence from guilt,&mdash;)

 <p>Where still one sandy morsel testifieth man's original?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
 <p>Or hast thou some grand globe, some common hall of intellect,</p>
 <p>Some spacious market-place for thought, where all do bring their wares,</p>
 <p>And gladly rescued from the littleness, the narrow closet of a self,</p>
 <p>The privileged soul hath large access, coming in the livery of learning?</p>
 <p>Live we as isolated worlds, perfect in substance and spirit,</p>
 <p>Each a sphere, with a special mind, prisoned in its shell of matter?</p>
 <p>Or rather, as converging radiations, parts of one majestic whole,</p>
 <p>Beams of the Sun, streams from the River, branches of the mighty Tree,</p>
 <p>Some bearing fruit, some bearing leaves, and some diseased and barren,&mdash;</p>
 <p>Some for the feast, some for the floor, and some&mdash;how many&mdash;for the fire?</p>
 <p>Memory may be but a power of coming to the treasury of Fact,</p>
 <p>A momentary self-desertion, an absence in spirit from the Now,</p>
 <p>An actual coursing hither and thither, by the mind, slipped from its leash,</p>
 <p>A life, as in the mystery of dreams, spent within the limits of a moment.</p>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">A brutish</span> man knoweth not this, neither can a fool comprehend it,</p>
 <p>But there be secrets of the Memory, deep, wondrous, and fearful.</p>
 <p>Were I at Petra, could I not declare, My soul hath been here before me?</p>
 <p>Am I strange to the columned halls, the calm dead grandeur of Palmyra?</p>
 <p>Know I not thy mount, O Carmel! Have I not voyaged on the Danube,</p>
 <p>Nor seen the glare of Arctic snows,&mdash;nor the black tents of the Tartar?</p>
 <p>Is it then a dream, that I remember the faces of them of old,</p>
 <p>While wandering in the grove with Plato, and listening to Zeno in the porch?</p>
 <p>Paul have I seen, and Pythagoras, and the Stagyrite hath spoken me friendly,</p>
 <p>And His meek eye looked also upon me, standing with Peter in the palace.</p>
 <p>Athens and Rome, Persepolis and Sparta, am I not a freeman of you all?</p>
 <p>And chiefly can my yearning heart forget thee, O Jerusalem?&mdash;</p>
 <p>For the strong magic of conception, mingled with the fumes of memory,</p>
 <p>Giveth me a life in all past time, yea, and addeth substance to the future.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
 <p>Be ye my judges, imaginative minds, full-fledged to soar into the sun,</p>
 <p>Whose grosser natural thoughts the chemistry of wisdom hath sublimed,</p>
 <p>Have ye not confessed to a feeling, a consciousness strange and vague,</p>
 <p>That ye have gone this way before, and walk again your daily life,</p>
 <p>Tracking an old routine, and on some foreign strand,</p>
 <p>Where bodily ye have never stood, finding your own footsteps?</p>
 <p>Hath not at times some recent friend looked out an old familiar,</p>
 <p>Some newest circumstance or place teemed as with ancient memories?</p>
 <p>A startling sudden flash lighteth up all for an instant,</p>
 <p>And then it is quenched, as in darkness, and leaveth the cold spirit trembling.</p>

 <p><span class="smcap">Memory</span> is not wisdom; idiots can rote volumes:</p>
 <p>Yet, what is wisdom without memory? a babe that is strangled in its birth,</p>
 <p>The path of the swallow in the air, the path of the dolphin in the waters,</p>
 <p>A cask running out, a bottomless chasm: such is wisdom without memory.</p>
 <p>There be many wise, who cannot store their knowledge;</p>
 <p>Yet from themselves are they satisfied, for the fountain is within:</p>
 <p>There be many who store, but have no wisdom of their own,</p>
 <p>Lumbering their armoury with weapons their muscles cannot lift:</p>
 <p>There be many thieves and robbers, who glean and store unlawfully,</p>
 <p>Calling in to memory's help some cunningly devised Cabala:</p>
 <p>But to feed the mind with fatness, to fill thy granary with corn,</p>
 <p>Nor clog with chaff and straw the threshing-floor of reason,</p>
 <p>Reap the ideas, and house them well; but leave the words high stubble:</p>
 <p>Strive to store up what was thought, despising what was said.</p>
 <p>For the mind is a spirit, and drinketh in ideas, as flame melteth into flame;</p>
 <p>But for words it must pack them as on floors, cumbrous and perishable merchandize.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
 <p>To be pained for a minute, to fear for an hour, to hope for a week&mdash;how long and weary!</p>
 <p>But to remember fourscore years, is to look back upon a day.</p>
 <p>An avenue seemeth to lengthen in the eyes of the wayfaring man,</p>
 <p>But let him turn, those stationed elms crowd up within a yard;</p>
 <p>Pace the lamp-lit streets of some sleeping city,</p>
 <p>The multitude of cressets shall seem one, in the false picture of perspective;</p>
 <p>Even so, in sweet treachery, dealeth the aged with himself,</p>
 <p>He gazeth on the green hill-tops, while the marshes beneath are hidden;</p>
 <p>And the partial telescope of memory pierceth the blank between,</p>
 <p>To look with lingering love at the fair star of childhood.</p>
 <p>Life is as the current spark on the miner's wheel of flints;</p>
 <p>Whiles it spinneth there is light; stop it, all is darkness:</p>
 <p>Life is as a morsel of frankincense burning in the hall of Eternity;</p>
 <p>It is gone, but its odorous cloud curleth to the lofty roof:</p>
 <p>Life is as a lump of salt, melting in the temple-laver;</p>
 <p>It is gone,&mdash;yet its savour reacheth to the farthest atom:</p>
 <p>Even so, for evil or for good, is life the criterion of a man,</p>
 <p>For its memories of sanctity or sin pervade all the firmament of being.</p>
 <p>There is but the flitting moment, wherein to hope or to enjoy,</p>
 <p>But in the calendar of Memory, that moment is all time.</p>

<h3>THE DREAM OF AMBITION.</h3>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="upper-case">I left</span> the happy fields that smile around the village of Content,</p>
 <p>And sought with wayward feet the torrid desert of Ambition.</p>
 <p>Long time, parched and weary, I travelled that burning sand,</p>
 <p>And the hooded basilisk and adder were strewed in my way for palms;</p>
 <p>Black scorpions thronged me round, with sharp uplifted stings,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
 <p>Seeming to mock me as I ran; (then I guessed it was a dream,&mdash;</p>
 <p>But life is oft so like a dream, we know not where we are.)</p>
 <p>So I toiled on, doubting in myself, up a steep gravel cliff,</p>
 <p>Whose yellow summit shot up far into the brazen sky;</p>
 <p>And quickly, I was wafted to the top, as upon unseen wings</p>
 <p>Carrying me upward like a leaf: (then I thought it was a dream,&mdash;</p>
 <p>Yet life is oft so like a dream, we know not where we are.)</p>
 <p>So I stood on the mountain, and behold! before me a giant pyramid,</p>
 <p>And I clomb with eager haste its high and difficult steps;</p>
 <p>For I longed, like another Belus, to mount up, yea, to heaven,</p>
 <p>Nor sought I rest until my feet had spurned the crest of earth.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Then</span> I sat on my granite throne under the burning sun,</p>
 <p>And the world lay smiling beneath me, but I was wrapt in flames;</p>
 (And I hoped, in glimmering consciousness, that all this torture was a dream,&mdash;
 <p>Yet life is oft so like a dream, we know not where we are.)</p>
 <p>And anon, as I sat scorching, the pyramid shuddered to its root,</p>
 <p>And I felt the quarried mass leap from its sand foundations:</p>
 <p>Awhile it tottered and tilted, as raised by invisible levers,&mdash;</p>
 (And now my reason spake with me; I knew it was a dream:
 <p>Yet I hushed that whisper into silence, for I hoped to learn of wisdom,</p>
 <p>By tracking up my truant thoughts, whereunto they might lead.)</p>
 <p>And suddenly, as rolling upon wheels, adown the cliff it rushed,</p>
 <p>And I thought, in my hot brain, of the Muscovites' icy slope;</p>
 <p>A thousand yards in a moment we ploughed the sandy seas,</p>
 <p>And crushed those happy fields, and that smiling village,</p>
 <p>And onward, as a living thing, still rushed my mighty throne,</p>
 <p>Thundering along, and pounding, as it went, the millions in my way:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
 <p>Before me all was life, and joy, and full-blown summer,</p>
 <p>Behind me death and woe, the desert and simoom.</p>
 <p>Then I wept and shrieked aloud, for pity and for fear;</p>
 <p>But might not stop, for, comet-like, flew on the maddened mass</p>
 <p>Over the crashing cities, and falling obelisks and towers,</p>
 <p>And columns, razed as by a scythe, and high domes, shivered as an egg-shell,</p>
 <p>And deep embattled ranks, and women, crowded in the streets,</p>
 <p>And children, kneeling as for mercy, and all I had ever loved,</p>
 <p>Yea, over all, mine awful throne rushed on with seeming instinct,&mdash;</p>
 <p>And over the crackling forests, and over the rugged beach,</p>
 <p>And on with a terrible hiss through the foaming wild Atlantic</p>
 <p>That roared around me as I sat, but could not quench my spirit,&mdash;</p>
 <p>Still on, through startled solitudes we shattered the pavement of the sea,</p>
 <p>Down, down, to that central vault, the bolted doors of hell;</p>
 <p>And these, with horrid shock, my huge throne battered in,</p>
 <p>And on to the deepest deep, where the fierce flames were hottest,</p>
 <p>Blazing tenfold as conquering furiously the seas that rushed in with me,&mdash;</p>
 <p>And there I stopped: and a fearful voice shouted in mine ear,</p>
 "Behold the home of Discontent; behold the rest of Ambition!"

<h3>OF SUBJECTION.</h3>

<div class="image-left">
  <img width="77" height="166" alt="" src="images/image22cr.jpg" />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Law</span>
 hath dominion over all things, over universal mind and matter;</p>
 <p>For there are reciprocities of right, which no creature can gainsay.</p>
 <p>Unto each was there added by its Maker, in the perfect chain of being,</p>
 <p>Dependencies and sustentations, accidents, and qualities, and powers:</p>
 <p>And each must fly forward in the curve, unto which it was forced from the beginning;</p>
 <p>Each must attract and repel, or the monarchy of Order is no more.</p>
 <p>Laws are essential emanations from the self-poised character of God,</p>
 <p>And they radiate from that sun to the circling edges of creation.</p>
 <p>Verily, the mighty Lawgiver hath subjected Himself unto Laws,</p>
 <p>And God is the primal grand example of free unstrained obedience;</p>
 <p>His perfection is limited by right, and cannot trespass into wrong,</p>
 <p>Because He hath established Himself as the fountain of only good,</p>
 <p>And in thus much is bounded, that the evil hath He left unto another,</p>
 <p>And that dark other hath usurped the evil which Omnipotence laid down.</p>
 <p>Unto God there exist impossibilities; for the True One cannot lie,</p>
 <p>Nor the Wise One wander from the track which He hath determined for Himself:</p>
 <p>For His will was purposed from eternity, strong in the love of order;</p>
 <p>And that will altereth not, as the law of the Medes and Persians.</p>
 <p>God is the origin of order, and the first exemplar of His precept;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
 <p>For there is subordination of His Essence, self-guided unto holiness;</p>
 <p>And there is subordination of His Persons, in due procession of dignity;</p>
 <p>For the Son, as a son, is subject; and to Him doth the Spirit minister:</p>
 <p>But these things be mysteries to man, he cannot reach nor fathom them,</p>
 <p>And ever must he speak in paradox, when labouring to expound his God;</p>
 <p>For, behold, God is alone, mighty in unshackled freedom;</p>
 <p>And with those wondrous Persons abideth eternal equality.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">So</span> then, start ye from the fountain, and follow the river of existence;</p>
 <p>For its current is bounded throughout by the banks of just subordination:</p>
 <p>Thrones, and dominions, and powers, Archangels, Cherubim, and Seraphim,</p>
 <p>Angels, and flaming ministers, and breathing chariots and harps.</p>
 <p>For there are degrees in heaven, and varied capabilities of bliss,</p>
 <p>And steps in the ladder of Intelligence, and ranks in approaches to Perfection:</p>
 <p>Doubtless, reverence is given, as their due, to the masters in wisdom;</p>
 <p>Doubtless, there are who serve; or a throne would have small glory.</p>
 <p>Regard now the universe of matter, the substance of visible creation,</p>
 <p>Which of old, with well-observing truth, the Greek hath surnamed, Order:</p>
 <p>Where is there an atom out of place? or a particle that yieldeth not obedience?</p>
 <p>Where is there a fragment that is free? or one thing the equal of another?&mdash;</p>
 <p>The chain is unbroken down to man, and beyond him the links are perfect:</p>
 <p>But he standeth solitary sin, a marvel of permitted chaos.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">And</span> shall this seeming error in the scale of due subordination</p>
 <p>Be a spot of desert unreclaimed, in the midst of the vineyard of the Lord?</p>
 <p>Shall his presumptuous pride snap the safe tether of connexion,</p>
 <p>And his blind selfish folly refuse the burden of maintenance?</p>
 <p>O man, thou art a creature; boast not thyself above the law:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>
 <p>Think not of thyself as free: thou art bound in the trammels of dependence.</p>
 <p>What is the sum of thy duty, but obedience to righteous rule;</p>
 <p>To the great commanding Oracle, uttered by delegated organs?</p>
 <p>Thou canst not render homage to abstract Omnipresent Power,</p>
 <p>Save through the concrete symbol of visible ordained authority.</p>
 <p>Those who obey not man, are oftenest found rebels against God;</p>
 <p>And seldom is the delegate so bold, as to order what he knoweth to be wrong.</p>
 <p>Yet mark me, proud gainsayer! I say not, obey unto sin;</p>
 <p>But, where the Principal is silent, take heed thou despise not the Deputy:</p>
 <p>And He that loveth order, will bless thee for thy faith,</p>
 <p>If thou recognize His sanction in the powers that fashion human laws.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Thou,</span> the vicegerent of the Lord, His high anointed image,</p>
 <p>Towards whom a good man's loyalty floweth from the heart of his religion,</p>
 <p>Thou, whose deep responsibilities are fathomed by a nation's prayers,</p>
 <p>Whom wise men fear for while they love, and envy thee nothing but thy virtues,</p>
 <p>From thy dizzy pinnacle of greatness, remember thou also art a subject,</p>
 <p>And the throne of thine earthly glory is itself but the footstool of thy God.</p>
 <p>The homage thy kingdoms yield thee, regard thou as yielded unto Him;</p>
 <p>And while girt with all the majesty of state, consider thee the Lord's chief servant:</p>
 <p>So shalt thou prosper, and be strong, grafted on the strength of Another;</p>
 <p>So shall thy royal heart be happy, in being humble.</p>
 <p>And thou shalt flourish as an oak, the monarch of thine island forests,</p>
 <p>Whose deep-dug roots are twisted around the stout ribs of the globe,</p>
 <p>That mocketh at the fury of the storm, and rejoiceth in summer sunshine,</p>
 <p>Glad in the smiles of heaven, and great in the stability of earth.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
 <p><span class="smcap">A ruler</span> hath not power for himself, neither is his pomp for his pride;</p>
 <p>But beneath the ermine of his office should he wear the rough hair-cloth of humility.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, every way obey him, so thou break not a higher commandment;</p>
 <p>For Nero was an evil king, yet Paul prescribeth subjection.</p>
 <p>If the rulers of a nation be holy, the Lord hath blessed that nation;</p>
 <p>If they be lewd and impious, chastisement hath come upon that people:</p>
 <p>For the bitterest scourge of a land is ungodliness in them that govern it,</p>
 <p>And the guilt of the sons of Josiah drove Israel weeping into Babylon.</p>
 <p>Yet be thou resolute against them, if they change the mandates of thy God,</p>
 <p>If they touch the ark of His covenant, wherein all His mercies are enshrined:</p>
 <p>Be resolute, but not rebellious; lest thou be of the company of Korah:</p>
 <p>Set thy face against them as a flint: but be not numbered with Abiram.</p>
 <p>Daniel nobly disobeyed; but not from a spirit of sedition:</p>
 <p>And Azarias shouted from the furnace,&mdash;I will not bow down, O <small>KING</small>.</p>
 <p>If truth must be sacrificed to unity, then faithfulness were folly;</p>
 <p>If man must be obeyed before God, the martyrs have bled in vain:</p>
 <p>Yet none of that blessed army reviled the rulers of the land,</p>
 <p>They were loud and bold against the sin, but bent before the ensign of authority.</p>
 <p>Honesty, scorning compromise, walketh most suitably with Reverence;</p>
 <p>Otherwise righteous daring may show but as obstinate rebellion:</p>
 <p>Therefore, suffer not thy censure to lack the savour of courtesy,</p>
 <p>And remember, the mortal sinneth, but the staff of his power is from God.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Man,</span> thou hast a social spirit, and art deeply indebted to thy kind:</p>
 <p>Therefore claim not all thy rights; but yield, for thine own advantage.</p>

 <p>The branch can not but wither, that is cut from the parent vine.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
 <p>Wouldst thou be a dweller in the woods, and cast away the cords that bind thee,</p>
 <p>Seeking, in thy bitterness or pride, to be exiled from thy fellows?</p>
 <p>Behold, the beasts shall hunt thee, weak, naked, houseless outcast,</p>
 <p>Disease and Death shall track thee out, as bloodhounds in the wilderness:</p>
 <p>Better to be vilest of the vile, in the hated company of men,</p>
 <p>Than to live a solitary wretch, dreading and wanting all things;</p>
 <p>Better to be chained to thy labour, in the dusky thoroughfares of life,</p>
 <p>Than to reign monarch of Sloth, in lonesome savage freedom.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Whence</span> then cometh the doctrine, that all should be equal and free?&mdash;</p>
 <p>It is the lie that crowded hell, when Seraphs flung away subjection.</p>
 <p>No man is his neighbour's equal, for no two minds are similar,</p>
 <p>And accidents, alike with qualities, have every shade but sameness:</p>
 <p>The lightest atom of difference shall destroy the nice balance of equality,</p>
 <p>And all things, from without and from within, make one man to differ from another.</p>
 <p>We are equal and free! was the watchword that spirited the legions of Satan;</p>
 <p>We are equal and free! is the double lie that entrappeth to him conscripts from earth:</p>
 <p>The messengers of that dark despot will pander to thy licence and thy pride,</p>
 <p>And draw thee from the crowd where thou art safe, to seize thee in the solitary desert.</p>
 <p>Woe unto him whose heart the syren-song of Liberty hath charmed;</p>
 <p>Woe unto him whose mind is bewitched by her treacherous beauty;</p>
 <p>In mad zeal flingeth he away the fetters of duty and restraint,</p>
 <p>And yieldeth up the holocaust of self to that fair Idol of the Damned.</p>
 <p>No man hath freedom in aught, save in that from which the wicked would be hindered,</p>
 <p>He is free toward God and good; but to all else a bondman.</p>

 <p>For the universe acquitteth thee with honour, fighting in defence of thy king.</p>
 <p>If a thief break thy dwelling, and thou take him, it were sin in thee to let him go;</p>
 <p>Yea, though he pleadeth to thy mercy, thou canst not spare him and be blameless:</p>

 <p>And the chance-guest, early departing, blesseth his kind stars,</p>
 <p>That on his humbler home hath brooded no domestic curse!</p>
 <p>Yet is that curse the fruit; wouldest thou the root of the evil?</p>
 <p>A kindness&mdash;most unkind, that hath always spared the rod;</p>
 <p>A weak and numbing indecision in the mind that should be master;</p>
 <p>A foolish love, pregnant of hate, that never frowned on sin;</p>
 <p>A moral cowardice of heart, that never dared command.</p>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">A kingdom</span> is a nest of families, and a family a small kingdom;</p>
 <p>And the government of whole or part differeth in nothing but extent.</p>
 <p>The house, where the master ruleth, is strong in united subjection,</p>
 <p>And the only commandment with promise, being honoured, is a blessing to that house:</p>
 <p>But and if he yieldeth up the reins, it is weak in discordant anarchy,</p>
 <p>And the bonds of love and union melt away, as ropes of sand.</p>
 <p>The realm, that is ruled with vigour, lacketh neither peace nor glory,</p>
 <p>It dreadeth not foes from without, nor the sons of riot from within:</p>

 <p>And the weakness of indulgent sloth ravageth its bowels with discord.</p>
 <p>The best of human governments is the patriarchal rule;</p>
 <p>The authorized supremacy of one, the prescriptive subjection of many:</p>

<h3>OF REST.</h3>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In the</span>
 silent watches of the night, calm night that breedeth thoughts,</p>
 <p>When the task-weary mind disporteth in the careless play-hours of sleep,</p>
 <p>I dreamed; and behold, a valley, green and sunny and well watered,</p>
 <p>And thousands moving across it, thousands and tens of thousands:</p>
 <p>And though many seemed faint and toil-worn, and stumbled often, and fell,</p>
 <p>Yet moved they on unresting, as the ever-flowing cataract.</p>
 <p>Then I noted adders in the grass, and pitfalls under the flowers,</p>
 <p>And chasms yawned among the hills, and the ground was cracked and slippery:</p>
 <p>But Hope and her brother Fear suffered not a foot to linger;</p>
 <p>Bright phantoms of false joys beckoned alluringly forward,</p>
 <p>While yelling grisly shapes of dread came hunting on behind:</p>
 <p>And ceaselessly, like Lapland swarms, that miserable crowd sped along</p>
 <p>To the mist-involved banks of a dark and sullen river.</p>
 <p>There saw I, midway in the water, standing a giant fisher,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
 <p>And he held many lines in his hand, and they called him Iron Destiny.</p>
 <p>So I tracked those subtle chains, and each held one among the multitude:</p>
 <p>Then I understood what hindered, that they rested not in their path:</p>
 <p>For the fisher had sport in his fishing, and drew in his lines continually,</p>
 <p>And the new-born babe, and the aged man, were dragged into that dark river:</p>
 <p>And he pulled all those myriads along, and none might rest by the way,</p>
 <p>Till many, for sheer weariness, were eager to plunge into the drowning stream.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">So I</span> knew that valley was Life, and it sloped to the waters of Death.</p>
 <p>But far on the thither side spread out a calm and silent shore,</p>
 <p>Where all was tranquil as a sleep, and the crowded strand was quiet:</p>
 <p>And I saw there many I had known, but their eyes glared chillingly upon me,</p>
 <p>As set in deepest slumber; and they pressed their fingers to their lips.</p>
 <p>Then I knew that shore was the dwelling of Rest, where spirits held their Sabbath,</p>
 <p>And it seemed they would have told me much, but they might not break that silence;</p>
 <p>For the law of their being was mystery: they glided on, hushing as they went.</p>
 <p>Yet further, under the sun, at the roots of purple mountains,</p>
 <p>I noted a blaze of glory, as the night-fires on northern skies;</p>
 <p>And I heard the hum of joy, as it were a sea of melody;</p>
 <p>And far as the eye could reach, were millions of happy creatures</p>
 <p>Basking in the golden light; and I knew that land was Heaven.</p>
 <p>Then the hill whereon I stood split asunder, and a crater yawned at my feet,</p>
 <p>Black and deep and dreadful, fenced round with ragged rocks;</p>
 <p>Dimly was the darkness lit up by spires of distant flame:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
 <p>And I saw below a moving mass of life, like reptiles bred in corruption,</p>
 <p>Where all was terrible unrest, shrieks and groans and thunder.</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">So I</span> woke, and I thought upon my dream; for it seemed of Wisdom's ministration.</p>
 <p>What man is he that findeth Rest, though he hunt for it year after year?</p>
 <p>As a child he had not yet been wearied, and cared not then to court it;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
 <p>As a youth he loved not to be quiet, for excitement spurred him into strife;</p>
 <p>As a man he tracketh rest in vain, toiling painfully to catch it,</p>
 <p>But still is he pulled from the pursuit, by the strong compulsion of his fate:</p>
 <p>So he hopeth to have peace in old age, as he cannot rest in manhood,</p>
 <p>But troubles thicken with his years, till Death hath dodged him to the grave.</p>
 <p>There remaineth a rest for the spirit on the shadowy side of life;</p>
 <p>But unto this world's pilgrim no rest for the sole of his foot.</p>
 <p>Ever, from stage to stage, he travelleth wearily forward,</p>
 <p>And though he pluck flowers by the way, he may not sleep among the flowers.</p>
 <p>Mind is the perpetual motion; for it is a running stream</p>
 <p>From an unfathomable source, the depth of the Divine Intelligence:</p>
 <p>And though it be stopped in its flowing, yet hath it a current within,</p>
 <p>The surface may sleep unruffled, but underneath are whirlpools of contention.</p>
 <p>Seekest thou rest, O mortal?&mdash;seek it no more on earth,</p>
 <p>For destiny will not cease from dragging thee through the rough wilderness of life;</p>
 <p>Seekest thou rest, O immortal?&mdash;hope not to find it in heaven,</p>
 <p>For sloth yieldeth not happiness: the bliss of a spirit is action.</p>
 <p>Rest dwelleth only on an island in the midst of the ocean of existence,</p>
 <p>Where the world-weary soul for a while may fold its tired wings,</p>
 <p>Until, after short sufficient slumber, it is quickened unto deathless energy,</p>
 <p>And speedeth in eagle flight to the Sun of unapproachable Perfection.</p>

<h3>OF HUMILITY.</h3>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="upper-case">Vice</span> is grown aweary of her gawds, and donneth russet garments,</p>
 <p>Loving for change to walk as a nun, beneath a modest veil:</p>
 <p>For Pride hath noted how all admire the fairness of Humility,</p>
 <p>And to clutch the praise he coveteth, is content to be drest in hair-cloth;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
 <p>And wily Lust tempteth the young heart, that is proof against the bravery of harlots,</p>
 <p>With timid tears and retiring looks of an artful seeming maid;</p>
 <p>And indolent Apathy, sleepily ashamed of his dull lack-lustre face,</p>
 <p>Is glad of the livery of meekness, that charitable cloak and cowl;</p>
 <p>And Hatred hideth his demon frown beneath a gentle mask;</p>
 <p>And Slander, snake-like, creepeth in the dust, thinking to escape recrimination.</p>
 <p>But the world hath gained somewhat from its years, and is quick to penetrate disguises,</p>
 <p>Neither in all these is it deceived, but divideth the true from the false.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Yet</span> there is a meanness of spirit, that is fair in the eyes of most men,</p>
 <p>Yea, and seemeth fair unto itself, loving to be thought Humility.</p>
 <p>Its choler is not roused by insolence, neither do injuries disturb it:</p>
 <p>Honest indignation is strange unto its breast, and just reproof unto its lip.</p>
 <p>It shrinketh, looking fearfully on men, fawning at the feet of the great;</p>
 <p>The breath of calumny is sweet unto its ear, and it courteth the rod of persecution.</p>
 <p>But what! art thou not a man, deputed chief of the creation?</p>
 <p>Art thou not a soldier of the right, militant for God and good?</p>
 <p>Shall virtue and truth be degraded, because thou art too base to uphold them?</p>
 <p>Or Goliath be bolder in blaspheming for want of a David in the camp?</p>
 <p>I say not, avenge injuries; for the ministry of vengeance is not thine:</p>
 <p>But wherefore rebuke not a liar? wherefore do dishonour to thyself?</p>
 <p>Wherefore let the evil triumph, when the just and the right are on thy side?</p>
 <p>Such Humility is abject, it lacketh the life of sensibility,</p>
 <p>And that resignation is but mock, where the burden is not felt:</p>
 <p>Suspect thyself and thy meekness: thou art mean and indifferent to sin;</p>
 <p>And the heart that should grieve and forgive, is case-hardened and forgetteth.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
 <p><span class="smcap">Humility</span> mainly becometh the converse of man with his Maker,</p>
 <p>But oftentimes it seemeth out of place in the intercourse of man with man:</p>
 <p>Yea, it is the cringer to his equal, that is chiefly seen bold to his God,</p>
 <p>While the martyr, whom a world cannot brow-beat, is humble as a child before Him.</p>
 <p>Render unto all men their due, but remember thou also art a man,</p>
 <p>And cheat not thyself of the reverence which is owing to thy reasonable being.</p>
 <p>Be courteous, and listen, and learn: but teach and answer if thou canst:</p>
 <p>Serve thee of thy neighbour's wisdom, but be not enslaved as to a master.</p>
 <p>Where thou perceivest knowledge, bend the ear of attention and respect;</p>
 <p>But yield not further to the teaching, than as thy mind is warranted by reasons.</p>
 <p>Better is an obstinate disputant, that yieldeth inch by inch,</p>
 <p>Than the shallow traitor to himself, who surrendereth to half an argument.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Modesty</span> winneth good report, but scorn cometh close upon servility;</p>
 <p>Therefore, use meekness with discretion, casting not pearls before swine.</p>
 <p>For a fool will tread upon thy neck, if he seeth thee lying in the dust;</p>
 <p>And there be companies and seasons where a resolute bearing is but duty.</p>
 <p>If a good man discloseth his secret failings unto the view of the profane,</p>
 <p>What doeth he but harm unto his brother, confirming him in his sin?</p>
 <p>There is a concealment that is right, and an open-mouthed humility that erreth;</p>
 <p>There is a candour near akin to folly, and a meekness looking like shame.</p>
 <p>Masculine sentiments, vigorously holden, well become a man;</p>
 <p>But a weak mind hath a timorous grasp, and mistaketh it for tenderness of conscience.</p>
 <p>Many are despised for their folly, who put it to the account of their religion,</p>
 <p>And because men treat them with contempt, they look to their God for glory;</p>
 <p>But contempt shall still be their reward, who betray their Master unto ridicule,</p>
 <p>Reflecting on Him in themselves, meanness and ignorance and cowardice.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
 <p>A Christian hath a royal spirit, and need not be ashamed but unto One:</p>
 <p>Among just men walketh he softly, but the world should see him as a champion.</p>
 <p>His humbleness is far unlike the shame that covereth the profligate and weak,</p>
 <p>When the sober reproof of virtue hath touched their tingling ears;</p>
 <p>It is born of love and wisdom, and is worthy of all honour,</p>
 <p>And the sweet persuasion of its smile changeth contempt into reverence.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">A man</span> of a haughty spirit is daily adding to his enemies:</p>
 <p>He standeth as the Arab in the desert, and the hands of all men are against him:</p>
 <p>A man of a base mind daily subtracteth from his friends,</p>
 <p>For he holdeth himself so cheaply, that others learn to despise him:</p>
 <p>But where the meekness of self-knowledge veileth the front of self-respect,</p>
 <p>There look thou for the man, whom none can know but they will honour.</p>
 <p>Humility is the softening shadow before the stature of Excellence,</p>
 <p>And lieth lowly on the ground, beloved and lovely as the violet:</p>
 <p>Humility is the fair-haired maid, that calleth Worth her brother,</p>
 <p>The gentle silent nurse, that fostereth infant virtues:</p>
 <p>Humility bringeth no excuse; she is welcome to God and to man:</p>
 <p>Her countenance is needful unto all, who would prosper in either world:</p>
 <p>And the mild light of her sweet face is mirrored in the eyes of her companions,</p>
 <p>And straightway stand they accepted, children of penitence and love.</p>
 <p>As when the blind man is nigh unto a rose, its sweetness is the herald of its beauty,</p>
 <p>So when thou savourest Humility, be sure thou art nigh unto merit.</p>
 <p>A gift rejoiceth the covetous, and praise fatteneth the vain,</p>
 <p>And the pride of man delighteth in the humble bearing of his fellow;</p>
 <p>But to the tender benevolence of the unthanked Almoner of good,</p>
 <p>Humility is queen among the graces, for she giveth Him occasion to bestow.</p>

<h3>OF PRIDE.</h3>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="upper-case">Deep</span> is the sea, and deep is hell, but Pride mineth deeper;</p>
 <p>It is coiled as a poisonous worm about the foundations of the soul.</p>
 <p>If thou expose it in thy motives, and track it in thy springs of thought,</p>
 <p>Complacent in its own detection, it will seem indignant virtue;</p>
 <p>Smoothly will it gratulate thy skill, O subtle anatomist of self,</p>
 <p>And spurn at its very being, while it nestleth the deeper in thy bosom.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
 <p>Pride is a double traitor, and betrayeth itself to entrap thee,</p>
 <p>Making thee vain of thy self-knowledge; proud of thy discoveries of Pride.</p>
 <p>Fruitlessly thou strainest for humility, by darkly diving into self;</p>
 <p>Rather look away from innate evil, and gaze upon extraneous good:</p>
 <p>For in sounding the deep things of the heart, thou shalt learn to be vain of its capacities,</p>
 <p>But in viewing the heights above thee, thou shalt be taught thy littleness:</p>
 <p>Could an emmet pry into itself, it might marvel at its own anatomy,</p>
 <p>But let it look on eagles, to discern how mean a thing it is.</p>
 <p>And all things hang upon comparison; to the greater, great is small:</p>
 <p>Neither is there anything so vile, but somewhat yet is viler:</p>
 <p>On all sides is there an infinity: the culprit at the gallows hath his worse,</p>
 <p>And the virgin martyr at the stake need not look far for a better.</p>
 <p>Therefore see thou that thine aim reacheth unto higher than thyself:</p>
 <p>Beware that the standard of thy soul wave from the loftiest battlement:</p>
 <p>For Pride is a pestilent meteor, flitting on the marshes of corruption,</p>
 <p>That will lure thee forward to thy death, if thou seek to track it to its source:</p>
 <p>Pride is a gloomy bow, arching the infernal firmament,</p>
 <p>That will lead thee on, if thou wilt hunt it, even to the dwelling of despair.</p>
 <p>Deep calleth unto deep, and mountain overtoppeth mountain,</p>
 <p>And still shalt thou fathom to no end the depth and the height of Pride:</p>
 <p>For it is the vast ambition of the soul, warped to an idol object,</p>
 <p>And nothing but a Deity in Self can quench its insatiable thirst.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Be</span> aware of the smiling enemy, that openly sheatheth his weapon,</p>
 <p>But mingleth poison in secret with the sacred salt of hospitality:</p>
 <p>For Pride will lie dormant in thy heart, to snatch his secret opportunity,</p>
 <p>Watching, as a lion-ant, in the bottom of his toils.</p>
 <p>Stay not to parley with thy foe, for his tongue is more potent than his arm;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
 <p>But be wiser, fighting against Pride in the simple panoply of prayer.</p>
 <p>As one also of the poets hath said, let not the Proteus escape thee;</p>
 <p>For he will blaze forth as fire, and quench himself in likeness of water;</p>
 <p>He will fright thee as a roaring beast, or charm thee as a subtle reptile.</p>
 <p>Mark, amid all his transformations, the complicate deceitfulness of Pride,</p>
 <p>And the more he striveth to elude thee, bind him the closer in thy toils.</p>
 <p>Prayer is the net that snareth him; prayer is the fetter that holdeth him:</p>
 <p>Thou canst not nourish Pride, while waiting as an almsman on thy God,&mdash;</p>
 <p>Waiting in sincerity and trust, or Pride shall meet thee even there;</p>
 <p>Yea, from the palaces of Heaven, hath Pride cast down his millions.</p>
 <p>Root up the mandrake from thy heart, though it cost thee blood and groans,</p>
 <p>Or the cherished garden of thy graces will fade and perish utterly.</p>

<h3>OF EXPERIENCE.</h3>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="upper-case">I knew</span> that age was enriched with the hard-earned wages of knowledge,</p>
 <p>And I saw that hoary wisdom was bred in the school of disappointment:</p>
 <p>I noted that the wisest of youth, though provident and cautious of evil,</p>
 <p>Yet sailed along unsteadily, as lacking some ballast of the mind:</p>
 <p>And the cause seemed to lie in this, that while they considered around them,</p>
 <p>And warded off all dangers from without, they forgat their own weakness within.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
 <p>So steer they in self-confidence, until, from the multitude of perils,</p>
 <p>They begin to be wary of themselves, and learn the first lesson of Experience.</p>
 <p>I knew that in the morning of life, before its wearisome journey,</p>
 <p>The youthful soul doth expand, in the simple luxury of being;</p>
 <p>It hath not contracted its wishes, nor set a limit to its hopes;</p>
 <p>The wing of fancy is unclipt, and sin hath not seared the feelings:</p>
 <p>Each feature is stamped with immortality, for all its desires are infinite,</p>
 <p>And it seeketh an ocean of happiness, to fill the deep hollow within.</p>
 <p>But the old and the grave look on, pitying that generous youth,</p>
 <p>For they also have tasted long ago the bitterness of hope destroyed:</p>
 <p>They pity him, and are sad, remembering the days that are past,</p>
 <p>But they know he must taste for himself, or he will not give ear to their wisdom.</p>
 <p>For Experience hath another lesson, which a man will do well if he learn,</p>
 <p>By checking the flight of expectation, to cheat disappointment of its pain.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Experience</span> teacheth many things, and all men are his scholars:</p>
 <p>Yet is he a strange tutor, unteaching that which he hath taught.</p>
 <p>Youth is confident, manhood wary, and old age confident again:</p>
 <p>Youth is kind, manhood cold, and age returneth unto kindness.</p>
 <p>For youth suspecteth nought, till manhood, bitterly learned,</p>
 <p>Mistrusteth all, overleaping the mark; and age correcteth his excess.</p>
 <p>Suspicion is the scaffold unto faith, a temporary needful eyesore,</p>
 <p>By which the strong man's dwelling is slowly builded up behind;</p>
 <p>But soon as the top-stone hath been set to the well-proved goodly edifice,</p>
 <p>The scaffold is torn down, and timely trust taketh its long leave of suspicion.</p>

 <p><span class="smcap">A thousand</span> volumes in a thousand tongues enshrine the lessons of Experience,</p>
 <p>Yet a man shall read them all, and go forth none the wiser:</p>
 <p>For self-love lendeth him a glass, to colour all he conneth,</p>
 <p>Lest in the features of another he find his own complexion.</p>
 <p>And we secretly judge of ourselves as differing greatly from all men,</p>
 <p>And love to challenge causes to show how we can master their effects:</p>
 <p>Pride is pampered in expecting that we need not fear a common fate,</p>
 <p>Or wrong-headed prejudice exulteth, in combating old Experience;</p>
 <p>Or perchance caprice and discontent are the spurs that goad us into danger,</p>
 <p>Careless, and half in hope to find there an enemy to joust with.</p>
 <p>Private Experience is an unsafe teacher, for we rarely learn both sides,</p>
 <p>And from the gilt surface reckon not on steel beneath:</p>
 <p>The torrid sons of Guinea think scorn of icy seas,</p>
 <p>And the frostbitten Greenlander disbelieveth suns too hot.</p>
 <p>But thou, student of Wisdom, feed on the marrow of the matter:</p>
 <p>If thou wilt suspect, let it be thyself; if thou wilt expect, let it not be gladness.</p>

 <p>When the footsteps of blinded innocence were tracked by burning plough-shares,</p>
 <p>And the still condemning water delivered up the wizard to the stake:</p>
 <p>For we wait, like the sage of Salamis, to see what the end will be,</p>
 <p>Fixing the right or the wrong, by the issues of failure or success.</p>
 <p>Judge not of things by their events: neither of character by providence;</p>

 <p>Prayer is not heard in that house; the day she hath loved to hallow</p>
 <p>Is noted but by deeper dissipation, the riot of luxury and gaming:</p>
 <p>And wantonness is in her master's eye, and she hath nowhere to flee to;</p>
 <p>She is cared for by none upon earth, and her God seemeth to forsake her.</p>
 <p>Then cometh, in fair show, the promise and the feint of affection,</p>
 <p>And her heart, long unused to kindness, remembereth her father, and loveth.</p>
 <p>And the villain hath wronged her trust, and mocked, and flung her from him,</p>
 <p>And men point at her and laugh; and women hate her as an outcast:</p>
 <p>But elsewhere, far other judgment seateth her&mdash;among the martyrs!</p>
 <p>And the Lord, who seemed to forsake, giveth double glory to the fallen.</p>

<h3>OF HATRED AND ANGER.</h3>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="upper-case">Blunted</span> unto goodness is the heart which anger never stirreth,</p>
 <p>But that which hatred swelleth, is keen to carve out evil.</p>
 <p>Anger is a noble infirmity, the generous failing of the just,</p>
 <p>The one degree that riseth above zeal, asserting the prerogatives of virtue:</p>
 <p>But hatred is a slow continuing crime, a fire in the bad man's breast,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
 <p>A dull and hungry flame, for ever craving insatiate.</p>
 <p>Hatred would harm another; anger would indulge itself:</p>
 <p>Hatred is a simmering poison; anger, the opening of a valve:</p>
 <p>Hatred destroyeth as the upas-tree; anger smiteth as a staff:</p>
 <p>Hatred is the atmosphere of hell; but anger is known in heaven.</p>
 <p>Is there not a righteous wrath, an anger just and holy,</p>
 <p>When goodness is sitting in the dust, and wickedness enthroned on Babel?</p>
 <p>Doth pity condemn guilt?&mdash;is justice not a feeling but a law</p>
 <p>Appealing to the line and to the plummet, incognizant of moral sense?</p>
 <p>Thou that condemnest anger, small is thy sympathy with angels,</p>
 <p>Thou that hast accounted it for sin, cold is thy communion with heaven.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Beware</span> of the angry in his passion; but fear not to approach him afterward;</p>
 <p>For if thou acknowledge thine error, he himself will be sorry for his wrath:</p>
 <p>Beware of the hater in his coolness; for he meditateth evil against thee:</p>
 <p>Commending the resources of his mind calmly to work thy ruin.</p>
 <p>Deceit and treachery skulk with hatred, but an honest spirit flieth with anger:</p>
 <p>The one lieth secret, as a serpent; the other chaseth, as a leopard.</p>
 <p>Speedily be reconciled in love, and receive the returning offender,</p>
 <p>For wittingly prolonging Anger, thou tamperest unconsciously with Hatred.</p>
 <p>Patience is power in a man, nerving him to rein his spirit:</p>
 <p>Passion is as palsy to his arm, while it yelleth on the coursers to their speed:</p>
 <p>Patience keepeth counsel, and standeth in solid self-possession,</p>
 <p>But the weakness of sudden passion layeth bare the secrets of the soul.</p>
 <p>The sentiment of anger is not ill, when thou lookest on the impudence of vice,</p>
 <p>Or savourest the breath of calumny, or hast earned the hard wages of injustice;</p>
 <p>But see that thou curb it in expression, rendering the mildness of rebuke,</p>
 <p>So shall thou stand without reproach, mailed in all the dignity of virtue.</p>

 the man of sin reproaching the goodness of Jehovah,</p>
 <p>Wherefore, if He be Almighty Love, permitteth He misery and pain?</p>
 <p>I saw the child of hope vexed in the labyrinth of doubt,</p>
 <p>Wherefore, O holy One and just, is the horn of Thy foul foe so high exalted?</p>
 <p>And, alas! for this our groaning world, for that grief and guilt are here;</p>
 <p>Alas! for that Earth is the battle-field, where good must combat with evil:</p>

 <p>Enough shall they be for conquest, and the motto of their standard is, <span class="smcap">Enough</span>.</p>
 <p>Thou art sad, O denizen of earth, for pains and diseases and death,</p>
 <p>But remember, thy hand hath earned them; grudge not at the wages of thy doings:</p>
 <p>Thy guilt, and thy fathers' guilt, must bring many sorrows in their company,</p>
 <p>And if thou wilt drink sweet poison, doubtless it shall rot thee to the core.</p>
 <p>What art thou but the heritor of evil, with a right to nothing good?</p>
 <p>The respite of an interval of ease were a boon which Justice might deny thee:</p>

 <p>And wait, thou child of hope, for time shall teach thee all things.</p>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Yet</span> hear, for my speech shall comfort thee: reverently, but with boldness,</p>
 <p>I would raise the sable curtain, that hideth the symmetry of Providence.</p>
 <p>Pain and sin are convicts, and toil in their fetters for good;</p>
 <p>The weapons of evil are turned against itself, fighting under better banners:</p>
 <p>The leech delighteth in stinging, and the wicked loveth to do harm,</p>
 <p>But the wise Physician of the Universe useth that ill tendency for health.</p>
 <p>Verily, from others' griefs are gendered sympathy and kindness;</p>
 <p>Patience, humility, and faith, spring not seldom from thine own:</p>
 <p>An enemy, humbled by his sorrows, cannot be far from thy forgiveness;</p>
 <p>A friend, who hath tasted of calamity, shall fan the dying incense of thy love:</p>
 <p>And for thyself, is it a small thing, so to learn thy frailty,</p>
 <p>That from an aching bone thou savest the whole body?</p>
 <p>The furnace of affliction may be fierce, but if it refineth thy soul,</p>
 <p>The good of one meek thought shall outweigh years of torment.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, wretched man, if thy bad heart be hardened in the flame,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
 <p>Being earth-born, as of clay, and not of moulded wax,</p>
 <p>Judge not the hand that smiteth, as if thou wert visited in wrath:</p>
 <p>Reproach thyself, for He is Justice; repent thee, for He is Mercy.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Cease,</span> fond caviller at wisdom, to be satisfied that everything is wrong:</p>
 <p>Be sure there is good necessity, even for the flourishing of evil.</p>
 <p>Would the eye delight in perpetual noon? or the ear in unqualified harmonics?</p>
 <p>Hath winter's frost no welcome, contrasting sturdily with summer?</p>
 <p>Couldst thou discern benevolence, if there were no sorrows to be soothed?</p>
 <p>Or discover the resources of contrivance, if nothing stood opposed to the means?</p>
 <p>What were power without an enemy? or mercy without an object?</p>
 <p>Or truth, where the false were impossible? or love, where love were a debt?</p>
 <p>The characters of God were but idle, if all things around Him were perfection,</p>
 <p>And virtues might slumber on like death, if they lacked the opportunities of evil.</p>
 <p>There is One all-perfect, and but one; man dare not reason of His essence:</p>
 <p>But there must be deficiencies in heaven, to leave room for progression in bliss:</p>
 <p>A realm of unqualified <small>BEST</small> were a stagnant pool of being,</p>
 <p>And the circle of absolute perfection, the abstract cipher of indolence.</p>
 <p>Sin is an awful shadow, but it addeth new glories to the light;</p>
 <p>Sin is a black foil, but it setteth off the jewelry of heaven:</p>
 <p>Sin is the traitor that hath dragged the majesty of mercy into action;</p>
 <p>Sin is the whelming argument, to justify the attribute of vengeance.</p>
 <p>It is a deep dark thought, and needeth to be diligently studied,</p>
 <p>But perchance evil was essential, that God should be seen of His creatures:</p>
 <p>For where perfection is not, there lacketh possible good,</p>
 <p>And the absence of better that might be, taketh from the praise of it is well:</p>
 <p>And creatures must be finite, and finite cannot be perfect:</p>
 <p>Therefore, though in small degree, creation involveth evil,</p>
 <p>He chargeth His angels with folly, and the heavens are not clean in His sight:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
 <p>For every existence in the universe hath either imperfection or Godhead:</p>
 <p>And the light that blazeth but in One, must be softened with shadow for the many.</p>
 <p>There is then good in evil; or none could have known his Maker;</p>
 <p>No spiritual intellect or essence could have gazed on His high perfections,</p>
 <p>No angel harps could have tuned the wonders of His wisdom,</p>
 <p>No ransomed souls have praised the glories of His mercy,</p>
 <p>No howling fiends have shown the terrors of His justice,</p>
 <p>But God would have dwelt alone, in the fearful solitude of holiness.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Nevertheless,</span> O sinner, harden not thine heart in evil;</p>
 <p>Nor plume thee in imaginary triumph, because thou art not valueless as vile;</p>
 <p>Because thy dark abominations add lustre to the clarity of Light;</p>
 <p>Because a wonder-working alchemy draineth elixir out of poisons;</p>
 <p>Because the same fiery volcano that scorcheth and ravageth a continent,</p>
 <p>Hath in the broad blue bay cast up some petty island;</p>
 <p>Because to the full demonstration of the qualities and accidents of good</p>
 <p>The swarthy legions of the Devil have toiled as unwitting pioneers.</p>
 <p>For sin is still sin; so hateful Love doth hate it;</p>
 <p>A blot on the glory of creation, which Justice must wipe out.</p>
 <p>Sin is a loathsome leprosy, fretting the white robe of innocence;</p>
 <p>A rottenness, eating out the heart of the royal cedars of Lebanon;</p>
 <p>A pestilential blast, the terror of that holy pilgrimage;</p>
 <p>A rent in the sacred veil, whereby God left His temple.</p>
 <p>Therefore, consider thyself, thou that dost not sorrow for thy guilt:</p>
 <p>Fear evil, or face its Enemy: dread sin, or dare Justice.</p>

 <p>So I heard the speech of the wicked, and, lo, it was smoother than oil;</p>
 <p>But I knew that his reasonings were false, for the promise of the Scripture is true:</p>
 <p>Yet was my soul in darkness, for his words were too hard for me;</p>
 <p>Till I turned to my God in prayer: for I know He heareth always.</p>
 <p>Then I looked abroad on the earth, and, behold, the Lord was in all things;</p>
 <p>Yet saw I not His hand in aught, but perceived that He worketh by means;</p>
 <p>Yea, and the power of the mean proveth the wisdom that ordained it,</p>
 <p>Yea, and no act is useless, to the hurling of a stone through the air.</p>
 <p>So I turned my thoughts to supplication, and beheld the mercies of Jehovah,</p>
 <p>And I saw sound argument was still the faithful friend of godliness;</p>
 <p>For as the rock of the affections is the solid approval of reason,</p>
 <p>Even so the temple of Religion is founded on the basis of Philosophy.</p>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Scorner,</span> thy thoughts are weak, they reach not the summit of the matter;</p>
 <p>Go to, for the mouth of a child might show thee the mystery of prayer:</p>
 <p>Verily, there is no change in the counsels of the Mighty Ruler:</p>
 <p>Verily, His purpose is strong, and rooted in the depths of necessity:</p>
 <p>But who hath shown thee His purpose, who hath made known to thee His will?</p>
 <p>When, O gainsayer! hast thou been schooled in the secrets of wisdom?</p>
 <p>Fate is a creature of God, and all things move in their orbits,</p>
 <p>And that which shall surely happen is known unto Him from eternity;</p>
 <p>But as, in the field of nature, He useth the sinews of the ox,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
 <p>And commandeth diligence and toil, Himself giving the increase;</p>
 <p>So, in the kingdom of His grace, granteth He omnipotence to prayer,</p>
 <p>For He knoweth what thou wilt ask, and what thou wilt ask aright.</p>
 <p>No man can pray in faith, whose prayer is not grounded on a promise:</p>
 <p>Yet a good man commendeth all things to the righteous wisdom of his God:</p>
 <p>For those, who pray in faith, trust the immutable Jehovah,</p>
 <p>And they, who ask blessings unpromised, lean on uncovenanted mercy.</p>

 <p><span class="smcap">Man,</span> regard thy prayers as a purpose of love to thy soul;</p>
 <p>Esteem the providence that led to them as an index of God's good will;</p>
 <p>So shalt thou pray aright, and thy words shall meet with acceptance.</p>
 <p>Also, in pleading for others, be thankful for the fulness of thy prayer:</p>
 <p>For if thou art ready to ask, the Lord is more ready to bestow.</p>
 <p>The salt preserveth the sea, and the saints uphold the earth;</p>
 <p>Their prayers are the thousand pillars that prop the canopy of nature.</p>
 <p>Verily, an hour without prayer, from some terrestrial mind,</p>
 <p>Were a curse in the calendar of time, a spot of the blackness of darkness.</p>
 <p>Perchance the terrible day, when the world must rock into ruins,</p>
 <p>Will be one unwhitened by prayer,&mdash;shall He find faith on the earth?</p>
 <p>For there is an economy of mercy, as of wisdom, and power, and means;</p>
 <p>Neither is one blessing granted, unbesought from the treasury of good:</p>
 <p>And the charitable heart of the Being, to depend upon whom is happiness,</p>
 <p>Never withholdeth a bounty, so long as His subject prayeth;</p>
 <p>Yea, ask what thou wilt, to the second throne in heaven,</p>
 <p>It is thine, for whom it was appointed; there is no limit unto prayer:</p>
 <p>But and if thou cease to ask, tremble, thou self-suspended creature,</p>
 <p>For thy strength is cut off as was Samson's: and the hour of thy doom is come.</p>

 <p>There is a model to thy hand; upon that do thou frame thy supplication;</p>
 <p>Wisdom hath measured its words; and redemption urgeth thee to use them.</p>
 <p>Call thy God thy Father, and yet not thine alone,</p>
 <p>For thou art but one of many, thy brotherhood is with all:</p>
 <p>Remember His high estate, that He dwelleth King of Heaven;</p>
 <p>So shall thy thoughts be humbled, nor love be unmixed with reverence:</p>
 <p>Be thy first petition unselfish, the honour of Him who made thee,</p>
 <p>And that in the depths of thy heart His memory be shrined in holiness:</p>
 <p>Pray for that blessed time, when good shall triumph over evil,</p>
 <p>And one universal temple echo the perfections of Jehovah:</p>
 <p>Bend thou to His good will, and subserve His holy purposes,</p>
 <p>Till in thee, and those around thee, grow a little heaven upon earth:</p>
 <p>Humbly, as a grateful almsman, beg thy bread of God,&mdash;</p>
 <p>Bread for thy triple estate, for thou hast a trinity of nature:</p>
 <p>Humility smootheth the way, and gratitude softeneth the heart,</p>
 <p>Be then thy prayer for pardon mingled with the tear of penitence;</p>
 <p>Yea, and while, all unworthy, thou leanest on the hand that should smite,</p>
 <p>Thou canst not from thy fellows withhold thy less forgiveness.</p>
 <p>To thy Father thy weaknesses are known, and thou hast not hid thy sin,</p>
 <p>Therefore ask Him, in all trust, to lead thee from the dangers of temptation;</p>
 <p>While the last petition of the soul, that breatheth on the confines of prayer,</p>
 <p>Is deliverance from sin and the evil one, the miseries of earth and hell.</p>
 <p>And wherefore, child of hope, should the rock of thy confidence be sure?</p>
 <p>Thou knowest that God heareth and promiseth an answer of peace;</p>
 <p>Thou knowest that He is King, and none can stay His hand;</p>
 <p>Thou knowest His power to be boundless, for there is none other:</p>
 <p>And to Him thou givest glory, as a creature of His workmanship and favour,</p>
 <p>For the never-ending term of thy saved and bright existence.</p>

 <p>A landmark tree was once a seed; and the dust in the balance maketh a difference;</p>

 <p>Full of unstoried flowers in the bubbling bloom-chalcedony:</p>
 <p>Or gay and curious shells, fretted with microscopic carving,</p>
 <p>Corallines, and fresh seaweeds, spreading forth their delicate branches.</p>
 <p>It is an admirable lore, to learn the cause in the change,</p>
 <p>To study the chemistry of Nature, her grand, but simple secrets,</p>
 <p>To search out all her wonders, to track the resources of her skill,</p>
 <p>To note her kind compensations, her unobtrusive excellence.</p>
 <p>In all it is wise happiness to see the well-ordained laws of Jehovah,</p>
 <p>The harmony that filleth all His mind, the justice that tempereth His bounty,</p>
 <p>The wonderful all-prevalent analogy that testifieth one Creator,</p>
 <p>The broad arrow of the Great King, carved on all the stores of His arsenal.</p>
 <p>But beware, O worshipper of God, thou forget not Him in His dealings,</p>
 <p>Though the bright emanations of His power hide Him in created glory;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
 <p>For if, on the sea of knowledge, thou regardest not the pole-star of religion,</p>
 <p>Thy bark will miss her port, and run upon the sand-bar of folly:</p>
 <p>And if, enamoured of the means, thou considerest not the scope to which they tend,</p>
 <p>Wherein art thou wiser than the child, that is pleased with toys and baubles?</p>
 <p>Verily, a trifling scholar, thou heedest but the letter of instruction:</p>
 <p>For, as motive is spirit unto action, as memory endeareth place,</p>
 <p>As the sun doth fertilize the earth, as affection quickeneth the heart,</p>
 <p>So is the remembrance of God in the varied wonders of creation.</p>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Man</span> hath found out inventions, to cheat him of the weariness of life,</p>
 <p>To help him to forget realities, and hide the misery of guilt.</p>

 <p>He joineth the circle of folly, and heapeth on the fire of excitement;</p>
 <p>Oftentimes sadly out of heart at the tiresome insipidity of pleasure,</p>
 <p>Oftentimes labouring in vain, convinced of the palpable deceit:</p>
 <p>Yet a man speaketh to his brother, in the voice of glad congratulation,</p>

 <p>The cheapest pleasures are the best; and nothing is more costly than sin;</p>
 <p>Yet we mortgage futurity, counting it but little loss:</p>

 <p>To seek uninstructive pleasure is to slumber on the couch of indolence.</p>

 <p>While the chance-met scholar of Wisdom learneth your sacred names:</p>
 <p>He is resting a little from his toil, yet a little on the borders of earth,</p>
 <p>And fain would he have you his friends, to bid him glad welcome hereafter.</p>
 <p>Who among the glorious art thou, that walkest a Goddess and a Queen,</p>
 <p>Thy crown of living stars, and a golden cross thy sceptre?</p>
 <p>Who among flowers of loveliness is she, thy seeming herald,</p>
 <p>Yet she boasteth not thee nor herself, and her garments are plain in their neatness?</p>
 <p>Wherefore is there one among the train, whose eyes are red with weeping,</p>
 <p>Yet is her open forehead beaming with the sun of ecstasy?</p>
 <p>And who is that bloodstained warrior, with glory sitting on his crest?</p>
 <p>And who that solemn sage, calm in majestic dignity?</p>
 <p>Also, in the lengthening troop see I some clad in robes of triumph,</p>
 <p>Whose fair and sunny faces I have known and loved on earth:</p>
 <p>Welcome, ye glorified Loves, Graces, and Sciences, and Muses,</p>
 <p>That, like sisters of charity, tended in this world's hospital;</p>
 <p>Welcome, for verily I knew, ye could not but be children of the light,</p>
 <p>Though earth hath soiled your robes, and robbed you of half your glory;</p>
 <p>Welcome, chiefly welcome, for I find I have friends in heaven,</p>
 <p>And some I might scarce have looked for, as thou, light-hearted Mirth;</p>
 <p>Thou also, star-robed Urania; and thou, with the curious glass,</p>
 <p>That rejoicedst in tracking wisdom where the eye was too dull to note it:</p>
 <p>And art thou too among the blessed, mild, much-injured Poetry?</p>
 <p>Who quickenest with light and beauty the leaden face of matter,</p>
 <p>Who not unheard, though silent, fillest earth's gardens with music,</p>
 <p>And not unseen, though a spirit, dost look down upon us from the stars,&mdash;</p>
 <p>That hast been to me for oil and for wine, to cheer and uphold my soul,</p>
 <p>When wearied, battling with the surge, the stunning surge of life:</p>
 <p>Of thee, for well have I loved thee, of thee may I ask in hope,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
 <p>Who among the glorious is she, that walketh a Goddess and a Queen?</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Son,</span> happy art thou that Wisdom hath led thee hitherward:</p>

 <p>Behold her, the life of men, the anchor of their shipwrecked hopes:</p>
 <p>Behold her, the shepherdess of souls, who bringeth back the wanderers to God.</p>
 <p>And for that modest herald, she is named on earth, Humility:</p>
 <p>And hast thou not known, my son, the tearful face of Repentance?</p>
 <p>Faith is yon time-scarred hero, walking in the shade of his laurels:</p>
 <p>And Reason, the serious sage, who followeth the footsteps of Faith:</p>
 <p>And we, all we, are but handmaids, ministers of minor bliss,</p>
 <p>Who rejoice to be counted servants in the train of a Queen so glorious:</p>
 <p>But for her name, son of man, it is strange to the language of heaven,</p>
 <p>For those who have never fallen need not and may not learn it:</p>
 <p>Ligeance we swear to our God, and ligeance well have we kept;</p>
 <p>It is only the band of the redeemed who can tell thee the fulness of that name;</p>

 not, shrewd reckoner, the God of a good man's worship,</p>
 <p>Neither let thy calculating folly gainsay the unity of three:</p>
 <p>Nor scorn another's creed, although he cannot solve thy doubts;</p>
 <p>Reason is the follower of faith, where he may not be precursor:</p>
 <p>It is written, and so we believe, waiting not for outward proof,</p>
 <p>Inasmuch as mysteries inscrutable are the clear prerogatives of godhead.</p>
 <p>Reason hath nothing positive, faith hath nothing doubtful;</p>
 <p>And the height of unbelieving wisdom is to question all things.</p>
 <p>When there is marvel in a doctrine, faith is joyful and adoreth;</p>
 <p>But when all is clear, what place is left for faith?</p>
 <p>Tell me the sum of thy knowledge,&mdash;is it yet assured of anything?</p>
 <p>Despise not what is wonderful, when all things are wonderful around thee.</p>
 <p>From the multitude of like effects, thou sayest, Behold a law:</p>
 <p>And the matter thou art baffled in unmaking, is to thy mind an element.</p>
 <p>Then look abroad, I pray thee, for analogy holdeth everywhere,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
 <p>And the Maker hath stamped His name on every creature of His hand:</p>
 <p>I know not of a matter or a spirit, that is not three in one,</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Man</span> talketh of himself as ignorant, but judgeth by himself as wise:</p>
 <p>His own guess counteth he truth, but the notions of another are his scorn;</p>

 <p>And suffer the passing speculation suggested by analogies to faith.</p>
 <p>Like begetteth like, and the great sea of Existence</p>
 <p>In each of its uncounted waves holdeth up a mirror to its Maker:</p>
 <p>Like begetteth like, and the spreading tree of being</p>
 <p>With each of its trefoil leaves pointeth at the Trinity of God.</p>
 <p>Let him whose eyes have been unfilmed, read this homily in all things,</p>
 <p>And thou, of duller sight, despise not him that readeth:</p>
 <p>There be three grand principles; life, generation, and obedience;</p>
 <p>Shadowing in every creature, the Spirit, and the Father, and the Son.</p>
 <p>There be three grand unities, variously mixed in trinities,</p>
 <p>Three catholic divisors of the million sums of matter:</p>
 <p>Yea, though science hath not seen it, climbing the ladder of experiment,</p>
 <p>Let faith, in the presence of her God, promulgate the mighty truth;</p>
 <p>Of three sole elements all nature's works consist:</p>
 <p>The pine, and the rock to which it clingeth, and the eagle sailing around it:</p>
 <p>The lion, and the northern whale, and the deeps wherein he sporteth;</p>
 <p>The lizard sleeping in the sun; the lightning flashing from a cloud;</p>
 <p>The rose, and the ruby, and the pearl; each one is made of three;</p>
 <p>And the three be the like ingredients, mingled in diverse measures.</p>
 <p>Thyself hast within thyself body, and life, and mind:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
 <p>Matter, and breath, and instinct, unite in all beasts of the field;</p>
 <p>Substance, coherence, and weight, fashion the fabrics of the earth;</p>
 <p>The will, the doing, and the deed, combine to frame a fact:</p>
 <p>The stem, the leaf, and the flower; beginning, middle, and end;</p>
 <p>Cause, circumstance, consequent: and every three is one.</p>
 <p>Yea, the very breath of man's life consisteth of a trinity of vapours,</p>
 <p>And the noonday light is a compound, the triune shadow of Jehovah.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Shall</span> all things else be in mystery, and God alone be understood?</p>
 <p>Shall finite fathom infinity, though it sound not the shallows of creation?</p>
 <p>Shall a man comprehend his Maker, being yet a riddle to himself?</p>
 <p>Or time teach the Lesson that eternity cannot master?</p>
 <p>If God be nothing more than one, a child can compass the thought;</p>
 <p>But seraphs fail to unravel the wondrous unity of three.</p>
 <p>One verily He is, for there can be but one who is all mighty;</p>
 <p>Yet the oracles of nature and religion proclaim Him three in one.</p>
 <p>And where were the value to thy soul, O miserable denizen of earth,</p>
 <p>Of the idle pageant of the cross, where hung no sacrifice for thee?</p>
 <p>Where the worth to thine impotent heart, of that stirred Bethesda,</p>
 <p>All numbed and palsied as it is, by the scorpion stings of sin?</p>
 <p>No, thy trinity of nature, enchained by treble death,</p>
 <p>Helplessly craveth of its God, Himself for three salvations:</p>
 <p>The soul to be reconciled in love, the mind to be glorified in light,</p>
 <p>While this poor dying body leapeth into life.</p>
 <p>And if indeed for us all the costly ransom hath been paid,</p>
 <p>Bethink thee, could less than Deity have owned so vast a treasure?</p>
 <p>Could a man contend with God, and stand against the bosses of His buckler,</p>
 <p>Rendering the balance for guilt, atonement to the uttermost?</p>
 <p>Thou art subtle to thine own thinking, but wisdom judgeth thee a fool,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
 <p>Resolving thou wilt not bow the knee to a Being thou canst not comprehend:</p>
 <p>The mind that could compass perfection were itself perfection's equal;</p>
 <p>And reason refuseth its homage to a God who can be fully understood.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Thou</span> that despiseth mystery, yet canst expound nothing,</p>
 <p>Wherefore rejectest thou the fact that solveth the enigma of all things?</p>

 <p>And puttest aside the key that would open the casket of truth?</p>
 <p>The mind and the nature of God are shadowed in all His works,</p>
 <p>And none could have guessed of His essence, had He not uttered it Himself.</p>
 <p>Therefore, thou child of folly, that scornest the record of His wisdom,</p>
 <p>Learn from the consistencies of nature the needful miracle of Godhead:</p>
 <p>Yea, let the heathen be thy teacher, who adoreth many gods,</p>
 <p>For there is no wide-spread error that hath not truth for its beginning.</p>
 <p>Be content; thine eye cannot see all the sides of a cube at one view,</p>
 <p>Nor thy mind in the self-same moment follow two ideas:</p>
 <p>There are now many marvels in thy creed, believing what thou seest,</p>
 <p>Then let not the conceit of intellect hinder thee from worshipping mystery.</p>

<h3>OF THINKING.</h3>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="upper-case">Reflection</span> is a flower of the mind, giving out wholesome fragrance,</p>
 <p>But reverie is the same flower, when rank and running to seed.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
 <p>Better to read little with thought, than much with levity and quickness;</p>
 <p>For mind is not as merchandize, which decreaseth in the using,</p>
 <p>But liker to the passions of man, which rejoice and expand in exertion:</p>
 <p>Yet live not wholly on thine own ideas, lest they lead thee astray;</p>
 <p>For in spirit, as in substance, thou art a social creature;</p>
 <p>And if thou leanest on thyself, thou rejectest the guidance of thy betters,</p>
 <p>Yea, thou contemnest all men,&mdash;Am I not wiser than they?&mdash;</p>
 <p>Foolish vanity hath blinded thee, and warped thy weak judgment:</p>
 <p>For, though new ideas flow from new springs, and enrich the treasury of knowledge,</p>
 <p>Yet listen often, ere thou think much; and look around thee ere thou judgest.</p>
 <p>Memory, the daughter of Attention, is the teeming mother of Wisdom,</p>
 <p>And safer is he that storeth knowledge, than he that would make it for himself.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Imagination</span> is not thought, neither is fancy reflection:</p>
 <p>Thought paceth like a hoary sage, but imagination hath wings as an eagle:</p>
 <p>Reflection sternly considereth, nor is sparing to condemn evil,</p>
 <p>But fancy lightly laugheth, in the sun-clad gardens of amusement.</p>
 <p>For the shy game of the fowler the quickest shot is the surest;</p>
 <p>But with slow care and measured aim the gunner pointeth his cannon:</p>
 <p>So for all less occasions, the surface-thought is best,</p>
 <p>But to be master of the great take thou heavier metal.</p>
 <p>It is a good thing, and a wholesome, to search out bosom sins,</p>
 <p>But to be the hero of selfish imaginings, is the subtle poison of pride:</p>
 <p>At night, in the stillness of thy chamber, guard and curb thy thoughts,</p>
 <p>And in recounting the doings of the day, beware that thou do it with prayer,</p>
 <p>Or thinking will be an idle pleasure, and retrospect yield no fruit.</p>
 <p>Steer the bark of thy mind from the syren isle of reverie,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span>
 <p>And let a watchful spirit mingle with the glance of recollection:</p>
 <p>Also, in examining thine heart, in sounding the fountain of thine actions,</p>
 <p>Be more careful of the evil than of the good; and humble thyself in thy sin.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">The</span> root of all wholesome thought is knowledge of thyself,</p>
 <p>For thus only canst thou learn the character of God toward thee.</p>
 <p>He made thee, and thou art; He redeemed thee, and thou wilt be:</p>
 <p>Thou art evil, yet He loveth thee; thou sinnest, yet He pardoneth thee.</p>
 <p>Though thou canst not perceive Him, yet is He in all His works,</p>
 <p>Infinite in grand outline, infinite in minute perfection:</p>
 <p>Nature is the chart of God, mapping out all His attributes;</p>
 <p>Art is the shadow of His wisdom, and copieth His resources.</p>
 <p>Thou knowest the laws of matter to be emanations of His will,</p>
 <p>And thy best reason for aught is this,&mdash;Thou, Lord, wouldst have it so.</p>
 <p>Yea, what is any law but an absolute decree of God?</p>
 <p>Or the properties of matter and mind, but the arbitrary fiats of Jehovah?</p>
 <p>He made and ordained necessity; He forged the chain of reason;</p>
 <p>And holdeth in His own right hand the first of the golden links.</p>
 <p>A fool regardeth mind as the spiritual essence of matter,</p>
 <p>And not rather matter as the gross accident of mind.</p>
 <p>Can finite govern infinite, or a part exceed the whole,</p>
 <p>Or the wisdom of God sit down at the feet of innate necessity?</p>
 <p>Necessity is a creature of His hand: for He can never change;</p>
 <p>And chance hath no existence where everything is needful.</p>

 <p>A word of anger is muttered, engendering the midnight murder:</p>
 <p>The sun bursteth from a cloud, and maddeneth the toiling husbandman.</p>
 <p>Shall these things be, and God not know it?</p>
 <p>Shall He know, and not be in them? shall He see, and not be among them?</p>
 <p>And how can they be otherwise than as He knoweth?</p>
 <p>Truly, the Lord is in all things; verily, He worketh in all.</p>
 <p>Think thus, and thy thoughts are firm, ascribing each circumstance to Him;</p>
 <p>Yet know surely, and believe the truth, that God willeth not evil;</p>
 <p>For adversities are blessings in disguise, and wickedness the Lord abhorreth:</p>
 <p>That He is in all things is an axiom, and that He is righteous in all:</p>
 <p>Ascribe holiness to Him, while thou musest on the mystery of sin,</p>

 <p>Which hath the praise, the machine or its maker,&mdash;the engine, or he that framed it?</p>
 <p>And could he frame it so subtly as to give it a will and freedom,</p>
 <p>Endow it with complicated powers, and a glorious living soul,</p>
 <p>Who, while he admireth the wondrous understanding creature,</p>
 <p>Will not pay deeper homage to the Maker of master minds?</p>
 <p>Otherwise, thou art senseless as the pagan, that adoreth his own handywork;</p>
 <p>Yea, while thou boastest of thy wisdom, thy mind is as the mind of the savage,</p>

 <p>Who can condense the sun, or analyse the fulness of the Bible,</p>
 <p>So that its ideas be gathered, and the harvest of its wisdom be brought in?</p>
 <p>That book is easy to the man who setteth his heart to understand it,</p>
 <p>But to the careless and profane it shall seem the foolishness of God;</p>
 <p>And it is a delicate test to prove thy moral state;</p>
 <p>To the humble disciple it is bread, but a stone to the proud and unbelieving:</p>
 <p>A scorner shall find nothing but the husks, wherewith to feed his hunger,</p>
 <p>But for the soul of the simple, it is plenty of full-ripe wheat.</p>
 <p>The Scripture abideth the same, in the sober majesty of truth;</p>
 <p>And the differing aspects of its teaching proceed from diversity in minds.</p>
 <p>He that would learn to think may gain that knowledge there;</p>
 <p>For the living word, as an angel, standeth at the gate of wisdom,</p>
 <p>And publisheth, This is the way, walk ye surely in it.</p>
 <p>Religion taketh by the hand the humble pupil of repentance,</p>
 <p>And teacheth him lessons of mystery, solving the questions of doubt;</p>
 <p>She maketh man worthy of himself, of his high prerogative of reason,</p>

 <p>Glittereth the star of mind in its unearthly lustre:</p>
 <p>Hast thou nought to tell us of thine airy joys,&mdash;</p>
 <p>When, borne on sinewy pinions, strong as the western condor,</p>
 <p>The soul, after soaring for a while round the cloud-capped Andes of reflection,</p>
 <p>Glad in its conscious immortality, leaveth a world behind,</p>

 <p>In half-shaped visions of sleep hast thou not feared thy flittings,</p>
 <p>Lest reason, like a raking hawk, return not to thy call:</p>
 <p>Nor waked to work-day life with throbbing head and heart,</p>
 <p>Nor welcomed early dawn to save thee from unrest?</p>

 <p>Captive and borne away on the warrior's foam-covered steed,</p>
 <p>And sinketh down wounded, as a gladiator on the sand,</p>
 <p>While the keen faulchion of Intellect is cutting through the scabbard of the brain.</p>
 <p>Imagination, like a shadowy giant looming on the twilight of the Hartz,</p>
 <p>Shall overwhelm judgment with affright, and scare him from his throne:</p>
 <p>In a dream thou mayst be mad, and feel the fire within thee;</p>
 <p>In a dream thou mayst travel out of self, and see thee with the eyes of another;</p>
 <p>Or sleep in thine own corpse: or wake as in many bodies;</p>
 <p>Or swell, as expanded to infinity; or shrink, as imprisoned to a point;</p>
 <p>Or among moss-grown ruins mayst wander with the sullen disembodied,</p>

 <p>To feel that thou art accountable separately from thy fellows:</p>
 <p>For a crowd hideth truth from the eyes, society drowneth thought,</p>

 <p>How dear to the mind of the sage are the thoughts that are bred in loneliness;</p>

 <p>Give me but a lodge in the wilderness, drop me on an island in the desert,</p>
 <p>And thought shall yield me happiness, though I may not increase it by imparting:</p>
 <p>For the soul never slumbereth, but is as the eye of the Eternal,</p>
 <p>And mind, the breath of God, knoweth not ideal vacuity:</p>
 <p>At night, after weariness and watching, the body sinketh into sleep,</p>
 <p>But the mental eye is awake, and thou reasonest in thy dreams:</p>
 <p>In a dream, thou mayst live a lifetime, and all be forgotten in the morning:</p>
 <p>Even such is life, and so soon perisheth its memory.</p>

 is the golden harvest that followeth the flowering of thought;</p>
 <p>Yet oftentimes runneth it to husk, and the grains be withered and scanty:</p>
 <p>Speech is reason's brother, and a kingly prerogative of man,</p>
 <p>That likeneth him to his Maker, who spake, and it was done:</p>
 <p>Spirit may mingle with spirit, but sense requireth a symbol;</p>
 <p>And speech is the body of a thought, without which it were not seen.</p>
 <p>When thou walkest, musing with thyself, in the green aisles of the forest,</p>
 <p>Utter thy thinkings aloud, that they take a shape and being:</p>
 <p>For he that pondereth in silence crowdeth the storehouse of his mind,</p>
 <p>And though he hath heaped great riches, yet is he hindered in the using.</p>
 <p>A man that speaketh too little, and thinketh much and deeply,</p>
 <p>Corrodeth his own heart-strings, and keepeth back good from his fellows:</p>
 <p>A man that speaketh too much, and museth but little and lightly,</p>
 <p>Wasteth his mind in words, and is counted a fool among men:</p>
 <p>But thou, when thou hast thought, weave charily the web of meditation,</p>
 <p>And clothe the ideal spirit in the suitable garments of speech.</p>

 <p>To be secret looketh like guilt, to speak out may breed contention:</p>

 <p>Provoke unneeded war by its rash ambassador the tongue:</p>
 <p>Often have I seen the charitable man go so slily on his mission,</p>
 <p>That those who met him in the twilight, took him for a skulking thief:</p>
 <p>I have heard the zealous youth telling out his holy secrets</p>
 <p>Before a swinish throng, who mocked him as he spake;</p>
 <p>And I considered, his openness was hardening them that mocked,</p>
 <p>Whereas a judicious keeping-back might have won their sympathy:</p>
 <p>I have judged rashly and harshly the hand, liberal in the dark,</p>
 <p>Because in the broad daylight, it hath holden it a virtue to be close;</p>
 <p>And the silent tongue have I condemned, because reserve hath chained it,</p>
 <p>That it hid, yea from a brother, the kindness it had done by comforting.</p>
 <p>No need to sound a trumpet, but less to hush a footfall:</p>
 <p>Do thou thy good openly, not as though the doing were a crime.</p>
 <p>Secresy goeth cowled, and Honesty demandeth wherefore?</p>
 <p>For he judgeth&mdash;judgeth he not well?&mdash;that nothing need be hid but guilt.</p>
 <p>Why should thy good be evil spoken of, through thine unrighteous silence?</p>
 <p>If thou art challenged, speak, and prove the good thou doest.</p>
 <p>The free example of benevolence, unobtruded, yet unhidden,</p>
 <p>Soundeth in the ears of sloth, Go, and do thou likewise:</p>
 <p>And I wot the hypocrite's sin to be of darker dye,</p>
 <p>Because the good man, fearing, thereby hideth his light:</p>
 <p>But neither God nor man hath bid thee cloak thy good,</p>
 <p>When a seasonable word would set thee in thy sphere, that all might see thy brightness.</p>
 <p>Ascribe the honour to thy Lord, but be thou jealous of that honour,</p>

 <p>The mouth is sealed as with lead, a cold weight presseth on the heart,</p>

 <p>Courage is cowed at the portal; wisdom is widowed of utterance;</p>
 <p>He that went to comfort is pitied; he that should rebuke, is silent:</p>
 <p>And fools who might listen and learn, stand by to look and laugh;</p>

 <p>And thought, finding not a vent, smouldereth, gnawing at the heart,</p>
 <p>And the man sinketh in his sphere, for lack of empty sounds.</p>
 <p>There be many cares and sorrows thou hast not yet considered,</p>
 <p>And well may thy soul rejoice in the fair privilege of speech;</p>

 <p>Whose heart and tongue have been touched, as of old, by the live coal from the altar,</p>
 <p>How wide the spreading of thy peace, how deep the draught of thy pleasures!</p>
 <p>To hold the multitude as one, breathing in measured cadence,</p>
 <p>A thousand men with flashing eyes, waiting upon thy will;</p>
 <p>A thousand hearts kindled by thee with consecrated fire,</p>
 <p>Ten flaming spiritual hecatombs offered on the mount of God:</p>
 <p>And now a pause, a thrilling pause,&mdash;they live but in thy words,&mdash;</p>

 <p>To think rightly, is of knowledge; to speak fluently, is of nature;</p>
 <p>To read with profit, is of care; but to write aptly, is of practice.</p>
 <p>No talent among men hath more scholars, and fewer masters:</p>
 <p>For to write is to speak beyond hearing, and none stand by to explain.</p>
 <p>To be accurate, write; to remember, write; to know thine own mind, write;</p>
 <p>And a written prayer is a prayer of faith: special, sure, and to be answered.</p>
 <p>Hast thou a thought upon thy brain, catch it while thou canst;</p>
 <p>Or other thoughts shall settle there, and this shall soon take wing:</p>
 <p>Thine uncompounded unity of soul, which argueth and maketh it immortal,</p>

 <p>Write often for thy secret eye; so shalt thou grow wiser.</p>

 <p>For therein the dead heart liveth, the clay-cold tongue is eloquent,</p>
 <p>And the quick eye of the reader is cleared by the reed of the scribe.</p>
 <p>As a fossil in the rock, or a coin in the mortar of a ruin,</p>
 <p>So the symbolled thoughts tell of a departed soul:</p>
 <p>The plastic hand hath its witness in a statue, and exactitude of vision in a picture,</p>

 <p>Labour, for the chapman at his trade, a dull unvaried round,</p>
 <p>Year after year, unto death; yea, what a weariness is it!</p>
 <p>Labour, for the pale-faced scribe, drudging at his hated desk,</p>
 <p>Who bartereth for needful pittance the untold gold of health;</p>
 <p>Labour, with fear, for the merchant, whose hopes are ventured on the sea;</p>
 <p>Labour, with care, for the man of law, responsible in his gains;</p>
 <p>Labour, with envy and annoyance, where strangers will thee wealth;</p>
 <p>Labour, with indolence and gloom, where wealth falleth from a father;</p>
 <p>Labour unto all, whether aching thews, or aching head, or spirit,&mdash;</p>
 <p>The curse on the sons of men, in all their states, is labour.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, to the diligent, labour bringeth blessing:</p>
 <p>The thought of duty sweeteneth toil, and travail is as pleasure;</p>
 <p>And time spent in doing hath a comfort that is not for the idle,</p>
 <p>The hardship is transmuted into joy by the dear alchemy of Mercy.</p>
 <p>Labour is good for a man, bracing up his energies to conquest,</p>
 <p>And without it life is dull, the man perceiving himself useless:</p>
 <p>For wearily the body groaneth, like a door on rusty hinges,</p>
 <p>And the grasp of the mind is weakened, as the talons of a caged vulture.</p>
 <p>Wealth hath never given happiness, but often hastened misery:</p>
 <p>Enough hath never caused misery, but often quickened happiness:</p>
 <p>Enough is less than thy thought, O pampered creature of society,</p>
 <p>And he that hath more than enough, is a thief of the rights of his brother.</p>

 is proud of his mind, boasting that it giveth him divinity,</p>
 <p>Yet with all its powers can it originate nothing;</p>
 <p>For the Great God into all His works hath largely poured out Himself,</p>
 <p>Saving one special property, the grand prerogative,&mdash;Creation.</p>
 <p>To improve and expand is ours, as well as to limit and defeat;</p>
 <p>But to create a thought or a thing is hopeless and impossible.</p>
 <p>Can a man make matter?&mdash;and yet this would-be god</p>
 <p>Thinketh to make mind, and form original idea:</p>
 <p>The potter must have his clay, and the mason his quarry,</p>
 <p>And mind must drain ideas from everything around it.</p>
 <p>Doth the soil generate herbs, or the torrid air breed flies,</p>
 <p>Or the water frame its monads, or the mist its swarming blight?&mdash;</p>
 <p>Mediately, through thousand generations, having seed within themselves,</p>
 <p>All things, rare or gross, own one common Father.</p>
 <p>Truly spake Wisdom, There is nothing new under the sun:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
 <p>We only arrange and combine the ancient elements of all things.</p>
 <p>Invention is activity of mind, as fire is air in motion;</p>
 <p>A sharpening of the spiritual sight, to discern hidden aptitudes:</p>
 <p>From the basket and acanthus, is modelled the graceful capital;</p>
 <p>The shadowed profile on the wall helpeth the limner to his likeness;</p>
 <p>The footmarks, stamped in clay, lead on the thoughts to printing;</p>
 <p>The strange skin garments cast upon the shore suggest another hemisphere:</p>
 <p>A falling apple taught the sage pervading gravitation;</p>
 <p>The Huron is certain of his prey, from tracks upon the grass:</p>
 <p>And shrewdness, guessing out the hint, followeth on the trail;</p>
 <p>But the hint must be given, the trail must be there, or the keenest sight is as blindness.</p>

 <p>And softening suns and splitting frosts crumble the reluctant surface;</p>
 <p>And cormorants roost there, and the snail addeth its slime,</p>
 <p>And efts, with muddy feet, bring their welcome tribute;</p>
 <p>And the sea casteth out her dead, wrapped in a shroud of weeds;</p>

 <p>The squirrel's jealous care planteth the fir-cone and the filbert:</p>

 <p>The savage is that rock; and a million chances from without,</p>
 <p>By little and little acting on the mind, heap up the hot-bed of society;</p>
 <p>And the soul, fed and fattened on the thoughts and things around it,</p>
 <p>Groweth to perfection, full of fruit, the fruit of foreign seeds.</p>
 <p>For we learn upon a hint, we find upon a clue,</p>
 <p>We yield an hundred-fold; but the great sower is Analogy.</p>
 <p>There must be an acrid sloe before a luscious peach,</p>
 <p>A boll of rotting flax before the bridal veil,</p>
 <p>An egg before an eagle, a thought before a thing,</p>
 <p>A spark struck into tinder to light the lamp of knowledge,</p>
 <p>A slight suggestive nod to guide the watching mind,</p>
 <p>A half-seen hand upon the wall, pointing to the balance of Comparison.</p>
 <p>By culture man may do all things, short of the miracle,&mdash;Creation;</p>
 <p>Here is the limit of thy power,&mdash;here let thy pride be stayed:</p>
 <p>The soil may be rich, and the mind may be active, but neither yield unsown;</p>
 <p>The eye cannot make light, nor the mind make spirit.</p>
 <p>Therefore it is wise in man to name all novelty Invention;</p>
 <p>For it is to find out things that are, not to create the unexisting:</p>
 <p>It is to cling to contiguities, to be keen in catching likeness,</p>
 <p>And with energetic elasticity to leap the gulphs of contrast.</p>
 <p>The globe knoweth not increase, either of matter or spirit;</p>
 <p>Atoms and thoughts are used again, mixing in varied combinations;</p>
 <p>And though, by moulding them anew, thou makest them thine own,</p>
 <p>Yet have they served thousands, and all their merit is of God.</p>

<h3>OF RIDICULE.</h3>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="upper-case">Seams</span> of thought for the sage's brow, and laughing lines for the fool's face;</p>
 <p>For all things leave their track in the mind; and the glass of the mind is faithful.</p>
 <p>Seest thou much mirth upon the cheek? there is then little exercise of virtue;</p>
 <p>For he that looketh on the world, cannot be glad and good:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
 <p>Seest thou much gravity in the eye? be not assured of finding wisdom;</p>
 <p>For she hath too great praise, not to get many mimics.</p>
 <p>There is a grave-faced folly; and verily, a laughter-loving wisdom;</p>
 <p>And what, if surface-judges account it vain frivolity?</p>
 <p>There is indeed an evil in excess, and a field may lie fallow too long;</p>
 <p>Yet merriment is often as a froth, that mantleth on the strong mind:</p>
 <p>And note thou this for a verity,&mdash;the subtlest thinker when alone,</p>
 <p>From ease of thoughts unbent, will laugh the loudest with his fellows:</p>
 <p>And well is the loveliness of wisdom mirrored in a cheerful countenance,</p>
 <p>Justly the deepest pools are proved by dimpling eddies;</p>
 <p>For that, a true philosophy commandeth an innocent life,</p>
 <p>And the unguilty spirit is lighter than a linnet's heart:</p>
 <p>Yea, there is no cosmetic like a holy conscience;</p>
 <p>The eye is bright with trust, the cheek bloomed over with affection,</p>
 <p>The brow unwrinkled by a care, and the lip triumphant in its gladness.</p>

 <p>How ruefully she sigheth after chances long gone by,</p>
 <p>How sulkily she moaneth over evils without cure!</p>
 <p>I have known a true-born mirth, the child of innocence and wisdom,</p>
 <p>I have seen a base-born gravity, mingled of ignorance and guilt:</p>
 <p>And again, a base-born mirth, springing out of carelessness and folly;</p>
 <p>And again, a true-born gravity, the product of reflection and right fear.</p>
 <p>The wounded partridge hideth in a furrow, and a stricken conscience would be left alone;</p>
 <p>But when its breast is healed, it runneth gladly with its fellows:</p>
 <p>Whereas the solitary heron, standing in the sedgy fen,</p>
 <p>Holdeth aloof from the social world, intent on wiles and death.</p>

 <p><span class="smcap">Need</span> but of light philosophy to dare the world's dread laugh;</p>
 <p>For a little mind courteth notoriety, to illustrate its puny self:</p>
 <p>But the sneer of a man's own comrades trieth the muscles of courage,</p>
 <p>And to be derided in his home is as a viper in the nest:</p>
 <p>The laugh of a hooting world hath in it a notion of sublimity,</p>
 <p>But the tittering private circle stingeth as a hive of wasps.</p>
 <p>Some have commended ridicule, counting it the test of truth,</p>
 <p>But neither wittily nor wisely; for truth must prove ridicule:</p>
 <p>Otherwise a blunt bulrush is to pierce the proof armour of argument,</p>
 <p>Because the stolidity of ignorance took it for a barbed shaft.</p>
 <p>Softer is the hide of the rhinoceros, than the heart of deriding unbelief,</p>
 <p>And truth is idler there, than the Bushman's feathered reed:</p>
 <p>A droll conceit parrieth a thrust, that should have hit the conscience,</p>
 <p>And the leering looks of humour tickle the childish mind;</p>
 <p>For that the matter of a man is mingled most with folly,</p>
 <p>Neither can he long endure the searching gaze of wisdom.</p>
 <p>It is pleasanter to see a laughing cheek than a serious forehead,</p>
 <p>And there liveth not one among a thousand whose idol is not pleasure.</p>
 <p>Ridicule is a weak weapon, when levelled at a strong mind:</p>
 <p>But common men are cowards, and dread an empty laugh.</p>
 <p>Fear a nettle, and touch it tenderly, its poison shall burn thee to the shoulder;</p>
 <p>But grasp it with a bold hand,&mdash;is it not a bundle of myrrh?</p>
 <p>Betray mean terror of ridicule, thou shalt find fools enough to mock thee;</p>
 <p>But answer thou their laughter with contempt, and the scoffers will lick thy feet.</p>

 <p>Yet is it a dangerous hearing, for the sweetness may lull thee into slumber,</p>

 <p>His bark is shallow in the water, and a sudden gust shall sink it:</p>
 <p>Praise a wise man, and speed him on his way; for he carrieth the ballast of humility,</p>
 <p>And is glad when his course is cheered by the sympathy of brethren ashore.</p>
 <p>The praise of a good man is good, for he holdeth up the mirror of Truth,</p>
 <p>That Virtue may see her own beauty, and delight in her own fair face:</p>
 <p>The praise of a bad man is evil, for he hideth the deformity of Vice,</p>
 <p>Casting the mantle of a queen around the limbs of a leper.</p>
 <p>Praise is rebuke to the man whose conscience alloweth it not:</p>
 <p>And where conscience feeleth it her due, no praise is better than a little.</p>
 <p>He that despiseth the outward appearance, despiseth the esteem of his fellows;</p>
 <p>And he that overmuch regardeth it, shall earn only their contempt:</p>
 <p>The honest commendation of an equal no one can scorn, and be blameless,</p>
 <p>Yet even that fair fame no one can hunt for, and be honoured:</p>
 <p>If it come, accept it and be thankful, and be thou humble in accepting;</p>
 <p>If it tarry, be not thou cast down; the bee can gather honey out of rue:</p>
 <p>And is thine aim so low, that the breath of those around thee</p>
 <p>Can speed thy feathered arrow, or retard its flight?</p>
 <p>The child shooteth at a butterfly, but the man's mark is an eagle;</p>
 <p>And while his fellows talk, he hath conquered in the clouds.</p>
 <p>Ally thee to truth and godliness, and use the talents in thy charge;</p>
 <p>So shall thou walk in peace, deserving, if not having.</p>
 <p>With a friend, praise him when thou canst; for many a friendship hath decayed,</p>
 <p>Like a plant in a crowded corner, for want of sunshine on its leaves:</p>
 <p>With another, praise him not often&mdash;otherwise he shall despise thee;</p>
 <p>But be thou frugal in commending; so will he give honour to thy judgment:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span>
 <p>For thou that dost so zealously commend, art acknowledging thine own inferiority,</p>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Wilt</span> thou that one remember a thing?&mdash;praise him in the midst of thy advice;</p>
 <p>Never yet forgat man the word whereby he hath been praised.</p>
 <p>Better to be censured by a thousand fools, than approved but by one man that is wise;</p>
 <p>For the pious are slower to help right, than the profane to hinder it:</p>
 <p>So, where the world rebuketh, there look thou for the excellent,</p>
 <p>And be suspicious of the good, which wicked men can praise.</p>
 <p>The captain bindeth his troop, not more by severity than kindness,</p>

 <p>The laurel is cheap to the giver, but precious in his sight who hath won it,</p>
 <p>And the heart of the soldier rejoiceth in the approving glance of his chief.</p>
 <p>Timely given praise is even better than the merited rebuke of censure,</p>
 <p>For the sun is more needful to the plant than the knife that cutteth out a canker.</p>
 <p>Many a father hath erred, in that he hath withheld reproof,</p>
 <p>But more have mostly sinned, in withholding praise where it was due:</p>
 <p>There be many such as Eli among men; but these be more culpable than Eli,</p>
 <p>Who chill the fountain of exertion by the freezing looks of indifference:</p>
 <p>Ye call a man easy and good, yet he is as a two-edged sword;</p>
 <p>He rebuketh not vice, and it is strong: he comforteth not virtue, and it fainteth.</p>
 <p>There is nothing more potent among men than a gift timely bestowed;</p>
 <p>And a gift kept back where it was hoped, separateth chief friends:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>

 <p>And his stubbornness never shall acknowledge the good he hath taken from thy hand:</p>
 <p>Yea, rather will he turn and be thy foe, lest thou gather from his friendship</p>
 <p>That he doth account thee creditor, and standeth in the second place.</p>
 <p>Still, O kindly feeling heart, be not thou chilled by the thankless,</p>
 <p>Neither let the breath of gratitude fan thee into momentary heat:</p>
 <p>Do good for good's own sake, looking not to worthiness nor love;</p>
 <p>Fling thy grain among the rocks, cast thy bread upon the waters,</p>

 <p>And the full pleasure of a proselyte lieth in the flattering of self?</p>
 <p>A man of many praises meeteth many welcomes,</p>
 <p>But he, who blameth often, shall not keep a friend;</p>
 <p>The velvet-coated apricot is one thing, and the spiked horse-chestnut is another,</p>
 <p>A handle of smooth amber is pleasanter than rough buck-horn.</p>

 <p>Consider thy failings, heed thy propensities, search out thy latent virtues,</p>
 <p>Analyze the doubtful, cultivate the good, and crush the head of evil;</p>
 <p>So shalt thou catch with quick hand the golden ball of opportunity,</p>
 <p>The warrior armed shall be ready for the fray, beside his bridled steed;</p>
 <p>Thou shall ward off special harms, and have the sway of circumstance,</p>
 <p>And turn to thy special good the common current of events;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
 <p>Choosing from the wardrobe of the world, thou shalt suitably clothe thy spirit,</p>
 <p>Nor thrust the white hand of peace into the gauntlet of defiance:</p>
 <p>The shepherd shall go with a staff, and conquer by sling and stone;</p>
 <p>The soldier shall let alone the distaff, and the scribe lay down the sword;</p>
 <p>The man unlearned shall keep silence, and earn one attribute of wisdom,</p>
 <p>The sage be sparing of his lessons before unhearing ears:</p>
 <p>Calm shalt thou be, as a lion in repose, conscious of passive strength,</p>
 <p>And the shock that splitteth the globe, shall not unthrone thy self-possession.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Acquaint</span> thee with thyself, O man! so shalt thou be humble:</p>

 <p>The bitter fountains of self-seeking be sweeter than the waters of the Nile.</p>
 <p>But if thou lack that wisdom,&mdash;thy frail skiff is doomed,</p>

 <p>Untaught in that grand lore, thou standest, cased in steel,</p>

 <p>The teeming soil, and the buoyant sea, and undulating air,</p>
 <p>Golden crops, and bloomy fruits, and flowers, and precious gems,</p>
 <p>Choice perfumes and fair sights, soft touches and sweet music:</p>
 <p>For thee, shoaling up the bay, crowd the finny nations,</p>
 <p>For thee, the cattle on a thousand hills live, and labour, and die:</p>

 <p>Thou hast measured the belts of Saturn, thou hast weighed the moons of Jupiter,</p>
 <p>And seen, by reason's eye, the centre of thy globe;</p>
 <p>Subtly hast thou numbered by billions the leagues between sun and sun,</p>
 <p>And noted in thy book the coming of their shadows;</p>
 <p>With marvellous unerring truth, thou knowest to an inch and to an instant,</p>
 <p>The where and the when of the comet's path that shall seem to rush by at thy command:</p>
 <p>Arise, thou king of mind, and survey thy dignity!</p>
 <p>Yet more,&mdash;for once believe religion's flattering tale;</p>
 <p>Thou hast a soul, yea, and a God,&mdash;but be not therefore humbled;</p>
 <p>Thy Maker's self was glad to live and die&mdash;a man;</p>
 <p>The brightest jewel in His crown is voluntary manhood:</p>
 <p>By deep dishonour, and great price, bought He that envied freedom,</p>
 <p>But thou wast born an heir of all, thy Master scarce could earn.</p>
 <p>O climax unto pride, O triumph of humanity,</p>

 <p>Arise, thou Lord of all, thou greater than a God!&mdash;</p>
 <p>How saidst thou, wretched being?&mdash;cast thy glance within;</p>
 <p>Regard that painted sepulchre, the hovel of thy heart:</p>
 <p>Ha! with what fearful imagery swarmeth that small chamber;</p>
 <p>The horrid eye of murder, scowling in the dark,</p>
 <p>The bony hand of avarice, filching from the poor,</p>
 <p>The lurid fires of lust, the idiot face of folly,</p>
 <p>The sickening deed of cruelty, the foul fierce orgies of the drunken,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
 <p>Weak contemptible vanity, stubborn stolid unbelief,</p>
 <p>Envy's devilish sneer, and the vile features of ingratitude,&mdash;</p>
 <p>Man, hast thou seen enough? or are these full proof</p>
 <p>That thou art a miracle of mercy, and all thy dignity is dross?</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Well,</span> said the wisdom of earth, O mortal, know thyself;</p>

 <p>By knowledge of God cometh knowledge of good, and universal love is at thy heart.</p>
 <p>Every creature knoweth its capacities, running in the road of instinct,</p>
 <p>And reason must not lag behind, but serve itself of all proprieties:</p>
 <p>The swift to the race, and the strong to the burden, and the wise for right direction;</p>
 <p>For self-knowledge filleth with acceptance its niche in the temple of utility:</p>
 <p>But vainly wilt thou look for that knowledge, till the clue of all truth is in thy hand,</p>
 <p>For the labyrinth of man's heart windeth in complicate deceivings:</p>
 <p>Thou canst not sound its depths with the shallow plumb-line of reason,</p>
 <p>Till religion, the pilot of the soul, have lent thee her unfathomable coil:</p>
 <p>Therefore, for this grand knowledge, and knowledge is the parent of dominion,</p>
 <p>Learn God, thou shalt know thyself; yea, and shalt have mastery of all things.</p>

 <p>Shame upon Creation's lord, the fierce ensanguined despot:</p>

 <p>And yet must thy goad or thy thong add another sorrow to existence?</p>
 <p>What! art thou not content thy sin hath dragged down suffering and death</p>

 <p>The prodigal heir of creation hath gambled away his all,&mdash;</p>

 <p>From the death-moth and lace-winged dragon-fly, to the lady-bird and the gnat,</p>
 <p>The verdict of all things is unanimous, finding their master cruel:</p>
 <p>The dog, thy humble friend, thy trusting, honest friend;</p>
 <p>The ass, thine uncomplaining slave, drudging from morn to even;</p>
 <p>The lamb, and the timorous hare, and the labouring ox at plough;</p>
 <p>The speckled trout, basking in the shallow, and the partridge, gleaning in the stubble,</p>
 <p>And the stag at bay, and the worm in thy path, and the wild bird pining in captivity,</p>

<h3>OF FRIENDSHIP.</h3>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">As</span>
 frost to the bud, and blight to the blossom, even such is self-interest to Friendship:</p>
 <p>For Confidence cannot dwell where Selfishness is porter at the gate.</p>
 <p>If thou see thy friend to be selfish, thou canst not be sure of his honesty;</p>
 <p>And in seeking thine own weal, thou hast wronged the reliance of thy friend.</p>
 <p>Flattery hideth her varnished face when Friendship sitteth at his board:</p>
 <p>And the door is shut upon Suspicion, but Candour is bid glad welcome.</p>
 <p>For Friendship abhorreth doubt, its life is in mutual trust,</p>
 <p>And perisheth, when artful praise proveth it is sought for a purpose.</p>
 <p>A man may be good to thee at times, and render thee mighty service,</p>
 <p>Whom yet thy secret soul could not desire as a friend;</p>
 <p>For the sum of life is in trifles, and though, in the weightier masses,</p>
 <p>A man refuse thee not his purse, nay his all in thine utmost need,</p>
 <p>Yet if thou canst not feel that his character agreeth with thine own,</p>
 <p>Thou never wilt call him friend, though thou render him a heartful of gratitude.</p>
 <p>A coarse man grindeth harshly the finer feelings of his brother;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
 <p>A common mind will soon depart from the dull companionship of wisdom;</p>
 <p>A weak soul dareth not to follow in the track of vigour and decision;</p>
 <p>And the worldly regardeth with scorn the seeming foolishness of faith.</p>
 <p>A mountain is made up of atoms, and friendship of little matters,</p>
 <p>And if the atoms hold not together, the mountain is crumbled into dust.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Come,</span> I will show thee a friend; I will paint one worthy of thy trust:</p>
 <p>Thine heart shall not weary of him: thou shalt not secretly despise him.</p>
 <p>Thou art long in learning him, in unravelling all his worth;</p>
 <p>And he dazzleth not thine eyes at first, to be darkened in thy sight afterward,</p>
 <p>But riseth from small beginnings, and reacheth the height of thine esteem.</p>
 <p>He remembereth that thou art only man; he expecteth not great things from thee:</p>
 <p>And his forbearance toward thee silently teacheth thee to be considerate unto him.</p>
 <p>He despiseth not courtesy of manner, nor neglecteth the decencies of life:</p>
 <p>Nor mocketh the failings of others, nor is harsh in his censures before thee:</p>
 <p>For so, how couldst thou tell, if he talketh not of thee in ridicule?</p>
 <p>He withholdeth no secret from thee, and rejecteth not thine in turn;</p>
 <p>He shareth his joys with thee, and is glad to bear part in thy sorrows.</p>
 <p>Yet one thing, he loveth thee too well to show thee the corruptions of his heart:</p>
 <p>For as an ill example strengthened the hands of the wicked,</p>
 <p>So to put forward thy guilt, is a secret poison to thy friend:</p>
 <p>For the evil in his nature is comforted, and he warreth more weakly against it,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
 <p>If he find that the friend whom he honoureth, is a man more sinful than himself.</p>
 <p>I hear the communing of friends; ye speak out the fulness of your souls,</p>
 <p>And being but men, as men, ye own to all the sympathies of manhood:</p>
 <p>Confidence openeth the lips, indulgence beameth from the eye,</p>
 <p>The tongue loveth not boasting, the heart is made glad with kindness:</p>
 <p>And one standeth not as on a hill, beckoning to the other to follow,</p>
 <p>But ye toil up hand in hand, and carry each other's burdens.</p>
 <p>Ye commune of hopes and aspirations, the fervent breathings of the heart,</p>
 <p>Ye speak with pleasant interchange the treasured secrets of affection,</p>
 <p>Ye listen to the voice of complaint, and whisper the language of comfort,</p>
 <p>And as in a double solitude, ye think in each other's hearing.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Choose</span> thy friend discreetly, and see thou consider his station,</p>
 <p>For the graduated scale of ranks accordeth with the ordinance of Heaven.</p>
 <p>If a low companion ripen to a friend, in the full sunshine of thy confidence,</p>
 <p>Know, that for old age thou hast heaped up sorrow;</p>
 <p>For thou sinkest to that level, and thy kin shall scorn thee,</p>
 <p>Yea, and the menial thou hast pampered haply shall neglect thee in thy death:</p>
 <p>And if thou reachest up to high estates, thinking to herd with princes,</p>
 <p>What art thou but a footstool, though so near a throne?</p>
 <p>O rush among the lilies, be taught thou art a weed,</p>
 <p>O briar among the cedars, hot contempt shall burn thee.</p>
 <p>But thou, friend and scholar, select from thine own caste,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span>
 <p>And make not an intimate of one, thy servant or thy master;</p>
 <p>For only friendship among men is the true republic,</p>
 <p>Where all have equality of service, and all have freedom of command.</p>
 <p>And yet, if thou wilt take my judgment, be shy of too much openness with any,</p>
 <p>Lest thou repent hereafter, should he turn and rend thee:</p>
 <p>For many an apostate friend hath abused unguarded confidence,</p>
 <p>And bent to selfish ends the secret of the soul.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Absence</span> strengthened friendship, where the last recollections were kindly;</p>
 <p>But it must be good wine at the last, or absence shall weaken it daily.</p>
 <p>A rare thing is faith, and friendship is a marvel among men,</p>
 <p>Yet strange faces call they friends, and say they believe when they doubt.</p>
 <p>Those hours are not lost that are spent in cementing affection;</p>
 <p>For a friend is above gold, precious as the stores of the mind.</p>
 <p>Be sparing of advice by words, but teach thy lesson by example:</p>
 <p>For the vanity of man may be wounded, and retort unkindly upon thee.</p>
 <p>There be some that never had a friend, because they were gross and selfish;</p>
 <p>Worldliness, and apathy, and pride, leave not many that are worthy:</p>
 <p>But one who meriteth esteem, need never lack a friend:</p>
 <p>For as thistle-down flieth abroad, and casteth its anchor in the soil,</p>
 <p>So philanthropy yearneth for a heart, where it may take root and blossom.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Yet</span> I hear the child of sensibility moaning at the wintry cold,</p>
 <p>Wherein the mists of selfishness have wrapped the society of men:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span>
 <p>He grieveth, and hath deep reasons; for falsehood hath wronged his trust,</p>
 <p>And the breaches in his bleeding heart have been filled with the briars of suspicion.</p>
 <p>For, alas, how few be friends, of whom charity hath hoped well!</p>
 <p>How few there be among men who forget themselves for other!</p>
 <p>Each one seeketh his own, and looketh on his brethren as rivals,</p>
 <p>Masking envy with friendship, to serve his secret ends.</p>
 <p>And the world, that corrupteth all good, hath wronged that sacred name,</p>
 <p>For it calleth any man friend, who is not known for an enemy:</p>
 <p>And such be as the flies of summer, while plenty sitteth at thy board:</p>
 <p>But who can wonder at their flight from the cold denials of want?</p>
 <p>Such be as vultures round a carcase, assembled together for the feast;</p>
 <p>But a sudden noise scareth them, and forthwith are they specks among the clouds.</p>
 <p>There be few, O child of sensibility, who deserve to have thy confidence;</p>
 <p>Yet weep not, for there are some, and such some live for thee:</p>
 <p>To them is the chilling world a drear and barren scene,</p>
 <p>And gladly seek they such as thou art, for seldom find they the occasion:</p>
 <p>For, though no man excludeth himself from the high capability of friendship,</p>
 <p>Yet verily the man is a marvel whom truth can write a friend.</p>

<h3>Of Love.</h3>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
 <p>Its root lieth deep: it is delicate, yet lasting, as the lilac crocus of autumn:</p>
 <p>Loneliness and thought are the dews that water it morn and even;</p>
 <p>Memory and Absence cherish it, as the balmy breathings of the south:</p>
 <p>Its sun is the brightness of Affection, and it bloometh in the borders of Hope;</p>
 <p>Its companions are gentle flowers, and the briar withereth by its side.</p>
 <p>I saw it budding in beauty; I felt the magic of its smile;</p>
 <p>The violet rejoiced beneath it, the rose stooped down and kissed it;</p>
 <p>And I thought some cherub had planted there a truant flower of Eden,</p>
 <p>As a bird bringeth foreign seeds, that they may flourish in a kindly soil.</p>
 <p>I saw, and asked not its name; I knew no language was so wealthy,</p>
 <p>Though every heart of every clime findeth its echo within.</p>
 <p>And yet what shall I say? Is a sordid man capable of Love?</p>
 <p>Hath a seducer known it? Can an adulterer perceive it?</p>
 <p>Or he that seeketh strange women, can he feel its purity?</p>
 <p>Or he that changeth often, can he know its truth?</p>
 <p>Longing for another's happiness, yet often destroying its own;</p>
 <p>Chaste, and looking up to God, as the fountain of tenderness and joy:</p>
 <p>Quiet, yet flowing deep, as the Rhine among rivers;</p>
 <p>Lasting, and knowing not change&mdash;it walketh with Truth and Sincerity.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Love</span>:&mdash;what a volume in a word, an ocean in a tear,</p>
 <p>A seventh heaven in a glance, a whirlwind in a sigh,</p>
 <p>The lightning in a touch, a millennium in a moment,</p>
 <p>What concentrated joy or woe in blest or blighted love!</p>
 <p>For it is that native poetry springing up indigenous to Mind,</p>
 <p>The heart's own-country music thrilling all its chords,</p>
 <p>The story without an end that angels throng to hear,</p>
 <p>The word, the king of words, carved on Jehovah's heart!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span>
 <p>Go, call thou snake-eyed malice mercy, call envy honest praise,</p>
 <p>Count selfish craft for wisdom, and coward treachery for prudence,</p>
 <p>Do homage to blaspheming unbelief as to bold and free philosophy,</p>
 <p>And estimate the recklessness of license as the right attribute of liberty,&mdash;</p>
 <p>But with the world, thou friend and scholar, stain not this pure name;</p>
 <p>Nor suffer the majesty of Love to be likened to the meanness of desire:</p>
 <p>For love is no more such, than seraphs' hymns are discord,</p>
 <p>And such is no more Love, than Etna's breath is summer.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Love</span> is a sweet idolatry enslaving all the soul,</p>
 <p>A mighty spiritual force, warring with the dulness of matter,</p>
 <p>An angel-mind breathed into a mortal, though fallen yet how beautiful!</p>
 <p>All the devotion of the heart in all its depth and grandeur.</p>
 <p>Behold that pale geranium, pent within the cottage window;</p>
 <p>How yearningly it stretcheth to the light its sickly long-stalked leaves,</p>
 <p>How it straineth upward to the sun, coveting his sweet influences,</p>
 <p>How real a living sacrifice to the god of all its worship!</p>
 <p>Such is the soul that loveth; and so the rose-tree of affection</p>
 <p>Bendeth its every leaf to look on those dear eyes,</p>
 <p>Its every blushing petal basketh in their light,</p>
 <p>And all its gladness, all its life, is hanging on their love.</p>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">If</span> the love of the heart is blighted, it buddeth not again:</p>

 <p>And the dim notes of that pleasant song will be heard as a reproachful spirit,</p>

 <p>Let her be a child of God, that she bring with her a blessing to thy house,&mdash;</p>
 <p>A blessing above riches, and leading contentment in its train:</p>
 <p>Let her be an heir of Heaven; so shall she help thee on thy way:</p>
 <p>For those who are one in faith, fight double-handed against evil.</p>
 <p>Take heed lest she love thee before God; that she be not an idolater:</p>
 <p>Yet see thou that she love thee well: for her heart is the heart of woman;</p>
 <p>And the triple nature of humanity must be bound by a triple chain,</p>
 <p>For soul and mind and body&mdash;godliness, esteem, and affection.</p>

 <p>But regard it not a pearl of price:&mdash;it is fleeting as the bow in the clouds.</p>
 <p>If the character within be gentle, it often hath its index in the countenance:</p>
 <p>The soft smile of a loving face is better than splendour that fadeth quickly.</p>
 <p>When thou choosest a wife, think not only of thyself,</p>

 <p>Ye have each a soul to be nourished, and a mind to be taught in wisdom,</p>
 <p>Therefore, as accountable for time, help one another to improve it.</p>
 <p>If ye feel love to decline, track out quickly the secret cause;</p>
 <p>Let it not rankle for a day, but confess and bewail it together:</p>

 <p>Now this is the sum of the matter:&mdash;if ye will be happy in marriage,</p>

<h3>OF EDUCATION.</h3>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="upper-case">A babe</span> in a house is a well-spring of pleasure, a messenger of peace and love:</p>
 <p>A resting place for innocence on earth; a link between angels and men:</p>
 <p>Yet is it a talent of trust, a loan to be rendered back with interest;</p>
 <p>A delight, but redolent of care; honey-sweet, but lacking not the bitter.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
 <p>For character groweth day by day, and all things aid it in unfolding,</p>
 <p>And the bent unto good or evil may be given in the hours of infancy:</p>
 <p>Scratch the green rind of a sapling, or wantonly twist it in the soil,</p>
 <p>The scarred and crooked oak will tell of thee for centuries to come;</p>
 <p>Even so mayst thou guide the mind to good, or lead it to the marrings of evil,</p>
 <p>For disposition is builded up by the fashioning of first impressions:</p>
 <p>Wherefore, though the voice of instruction waiteth for the ear of reason,</p>
 <p>Yet with his mother's milk the young child drinketh Education.</p>
 <p>Patience is the first great lesson; he may learn it at the breast:</p>
 <p>And the habit of obedience and trust may be grafted on his mind in the cradle:</p>
 <p>Hold the little hands in prayer, teach the weak knees their kneeling;</p>
 <p>Let him see thee speaking to thy God; he will not forget it afterward:</p>
 <p>When old and grey will he feelingly remember a mother's tender piety,</p>
 <p>And the touching recollection of her prayers shall arrest the strong man in his sin.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Select</span> not to nurse thy darling one that may taint his innocence,</p>
 <p>For example is a constant monitor, and good seed will die among the tares.</p>
 <p>The arts of a strange servant have spoiled a gentle disposition:</p>
 <p>Mother, let him learn of thy lips, and be nourished at thy breast.</p>
 <p>Character is mainly moulded by the cast of the minds that surround it:</p>
 <p>Let then the playmates of thy little one be not other than thy judgment shall approve:</p>
 <p>For a child is in a new world, and learneth somewhat every moment,</p>
 <p>His eye is quick to observe, his memory storeth in secret,</p>
 <p>His ear is greedy of knowledge, and his mind is plastic as soft wax.</p>
 <p>Beware then that he heareth what is good, that he feedeth not on evil maxims,</p>
 <p>For the seeds of first instructions are dropped into the deepest furrows.</p>
 <p>That which immemorial use hath sanctioned, seemeth to be right and true;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
 <p>Therefore, let him never have to recollect the time when good things were strangers to his thought.</p>
 <p>Strive not to centre in thyself, fond mother, all his love;</p>
 <p>Nay, do not thou so selfishly, but enlarge his heart for others;</p>
 <p>Use him to sympathy betimes, that he learn to be sad with the afflicted;</p>
 <p>And check not a child in his merriment,&mdash;should not his morning be sunny?</p>
 <p>Give him not all his desire, so shalt thou strengthen him in hope;</p>
 <p>Neither stop with indulgence the fountain of his tears, so shall he fear thy firmness.</p>
 <p>Above all things graft on him subjection, yea, in the veriest trifle;</p>
 <p>Courtesy to all, reverence to some, and to thee unanswering obedience.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Read</span> thou first, and well approve, the books thou givest to thy child;</p>
 <p>But remember the weakness of his thought, and that wisdom for him must be diluted:</p>
 <p>In the honied waters of infant tales, let him taste the strong wine of truth:</p>
 <p>Pathetic stories soften the heart; but legends of terror breed midnight misery;</p>
 <p>Fairy fictions cram the mind with folly, and knowledge of evil tempteth to like evil:</p>
 <p>Be not loth to curb imagination, nor be fearful that truths will depress it;</p>
 <p>And for evil, he will learn it soon enough; be not thou the devil's envoy.</p>
 <p>Induce not precocity of intellect, for so shouldst thou nourish vanity;</p>
 <p>Neither can a plant, forced in the hot-bed, stand against the frozen breath of winter.</p>
 <p>The mind is made wealthy by ideas, but the multitude of words is a clogging weight:</p>
 <p>Therefore be understood in thy teaching, and instruct to the measure of capacity.</p>
 <p>Analogy is milk for babes, but abstract truths are strong meat;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span>
 <p>Precepts and rules are repulsive to a child, but happy illustration winneth him:</p>
 <p>In vain shalt thou preach of industry and prudence, till he learn of the bee and the ant;</p>
 <p>Dimly will he think of his soul, till the acorn and the chrysalis have taught him;</p>
 <p>He will fear God in thunder, and worship His loveliness in flowers;</p>
 <p>And parables shall charm his heart, while doctrines seem dead mystery:</p>
 <p>Faith shall he learn of the husbandman casting good corn into the soil;</p>
 <p>And if thou train him to trust thee, he will not withhold his reliance from the Lord.</p>
 <p>Fearest thou the dark, poor child? I would not have thee left to thy terrors;</p>
 <p>Darkness is the semblance of evil, and nature regardeth it with dread:</p>
 <p>Yet know thy father's God is with thee still, to guard thee:</p>
 <p>It is a simple lesson of dependence; let thy tost mind anchor upon Him.</p>
 <p>Did a sudden noise affright thee? lo, this or that hath caused it:</p>
 <p>Things undefined are full of dread, and stagger stouter nerves.</p>
 <p>The seeds of misery and madness have been sowed in the nights of infancy;</p>
 <p>Therefore be careful that ghastly fears be not the night companions of thy child.</p>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Lo,</span> thou art a landmark on a hill; thy little ones copy thee in all things:</p>

 <p>Otherwise thy learning is hidden, and thus thou seemest unwise.</p>
 <p>A sluggard hath no respect; an epicure commandeth not reverence;</p>
 <p>Meanness is always despicable, and folly provoketh contempt.</p>
 <p>Those parents are best honoured whose characters best deserve it;</p>
 <p>Show me a child undutiful, I shall know where to look for a foolish father:</p>
 <p>Never hath a father done his duty, and lived to be despised of his son:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">{171}</a></span>
 <p>But how can that son reverence an example he dare not follow?</p>
 <p>Should he imitate thee in thine evil? his scorn is thy rebuke.</p>
 <p>Nay, but bring him up aright, in obedience to God and to thee;</p>
 <p>Begin betimes, lest thou fail of his fear; and with judgment, that thou lose not his love:</p>
 <p>Herein use good discretion, and govern not all alike,</p>
 <p>Yet, perhaps, the fault will be in thee, if kindness prove not all sufficient:</p>
 <p>By kindness, the wolf and the zebra become docile as the spaniel and the horse;</p>
 <p>The kite feedeth with the starling, under the law of kindness:</p>
 <p>That law shall tame the fiercest, bring down the battlements of pride,</p>
 <p>Cherish the weak, control the strong, and win the fearful spirit.</p>
 <p>Be obeyed when thou commandest; but command not often:</p>
 <p>Let thy carriage be the gentleness of love, not the stern front of tyranny.</p>
 <p>Make not one child a warning to another; but chide the offender apart:</p>
 <p>For self-conceit and wounded pride rankle like poisons in the soul.</p>
 <p>A mild rebuke in the season of calmness, is better than a rod in the heat of passion;</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, spare not, if thy word hath passed for punishment;</p>
 <p>Let not thy child see thee humbled, nor learn to think thee false;</p>
 <p>Suffer none to reprove thee before him, and reprove not thine own purposes by change;</p>
 <p>Yet speedily turn thou again, and reward him where thou canst,</p>
 <p>For kind encouragement in good cutteth at the roots of evil.</p>

 <p>Alas! for the price above gold, by which such learning cometh!</p>

 <p>Oaths and foul-mouthed sin burn in the language of the idle:</p>

 <p>True, ye are now less pure, and therefore are more wretched:</p>
 <p>But have ye quite forgotten how sorely ye travailed at your tasks,</p>
 <p>How childish griefs and disappointments bowed down the childish mind?</p>
 <p>How sorrow sat upon your pillow, and terror hath waked you up betimes,</p>
 <p>Dreading the strict hand of justice, that would not wait for a reason,</p>
 <p>Or the whims of petty tyrants, children like yourselves,</p>
 <p>Or the pestilent extract of evil poured into the ear of innocence?</p>
 <p>Behold the coral island, fresh from the floor of the Atlantic,</p>
 <p>It is dinted by every ripple, and a soft wave can smooth its surface;</p>
 <p>But soon its substance hardeneth in the winds and tropic sun,</p>
 <p>And weakly the foaming billows break against its adamantine wall:</p>
 <p>Even thus, though sin and care dash upon the firmness of manhood,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
 <p>The timid child is wasted most by his petty troubles;</p>
 <p>And seldom, when life is mature, and the strength proportioned to the burden,</p>
 <p>Will the feeling mind, that can remember, acknowledge to deeper anguish,</p>
 <p>Than when, as a stranger and a little one, the heart first ached with anxiety,</p>
 <p>And the sprouting buds of sensibility were bruised by the harshness of a school.</p>
 <p>My soul, look well around thee, ere thou give thine infant unto sorrows.</p>
 <p>Yet there be boisterous tempers, stout nerves, and stubborn hearts,</p>
 <p>And there is a riper season, when the mind is well disciplined in good,</p>
 <p>And a time, when youth may be bettered by the wholesome occasions of knowledge,</p>
 <p>Which rarely will he meet with so well, as among the congregation of his fellows.</p>

 <p>Nor lift the glass of truth alway before thy fellows:</p>
 <p>I say not, compromise the right, I would not have thee countenance the wrong,</p>
 <p>But hear with charitable heart the reasons of an honest judgment;</p>
 <p>For thou also hast erred, and knowest not when thou art most right,</p>
 <p>Nor whether to-morrow's wisdom may not prove thee simple to-day:</p>
 <p>Perchance thou art chiding in another what once thou wast thyself;</p>
 <p>Perchance thou sharply reprovest what thou wilt be hereafter.</p>
 <p>A man that can render a reason, is a man worthy of an answer;</p>
 <p>But he that argueth for victory, deserveth not the tenderness of Truth.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Whiles</span> a man liveth he may mend: count not thy brother reprobate;</p>
 <p>When he is dead his chance is gone: remember not his faults in bitterness.</p>
 <p>A man, till he dieth, is immortal in thy sight; and then he is as nothing:</p>
 <p>Make not the living thy foe, nor take weak vengeance of the dead.</p>
 <p>For life is as a game of chess, where least causeth greatest,</p>
 <p>And an ill move bringeth loss, and a pawn may ensure victory.</p>
 <p>Dost thou suspect? seek out certainty: for now, by self-inflicted pain,</p>
 <p>Or ill-directed wrath, thou wrongest thyself or thy neighbour:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
 <p>Suspicion is an early lesson, taught in the school of experience,</p>
 <p>Neither shalt thou easily unlearn it, though charity ply thee with her preaching;</p>
 <p>Yet look thou well for reasons, or ever mistrust hath marred thee,</p>
 <p>Or fear curdled thy blood, or jealousy goaded thee to madness;</p>
 <p>For a look, or a word, or an act, may be taken well or ill</p>
 <p>As construed by the latitude of love, or the closeness of cold suspicion.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Better</span> is the wrong with sincerity, rather than the right with falsehood:</p>
 <p>And a prudent man will not lay siege to the stronghold of ignorant bigotry.</p>
 <p>To unsettle a weak mind were an easy inglorious triumph,</p>
 <p>And a strong cause taketh little count of the worthless suffrage of a fool:</p>
 <p>Lightly he held to the wrong, loosely will he cling to the right;</p>
 <p>Weakness is the essence of his mind, and the reed cannot yield an acorn.</p>
 <p>Dogged obstinacy is oftentimes the buttress that proppeth an unstable spirit,</p>
 <p>But a candid man blusheth not to own, he is wiser to-day than yesterday.</p>
 <p>A man of a little wisdom is a sage among fools;</p>
 <p>But himself is chief among the fools, if he look for admiration from them.</p>
 <p>A heresy is an evil thing, for its shame is its pride:</p>
 <p>Its necessary difference of error is the character it most esteemeth:</p>
 <p>Give a man all things short of liberty, thou shalt have no thanks,</p>
 <p>And little wilt thou speed with thine opponent, by proving points he will concede.</p>
 <p>The tost sand darkeneth the waves; and clear had been the pages of truth,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
 <p>Had not the glosses of men obscured the simplicity of faith.</p>
 <p>In all things consider thine own ignorance, and gladly take occasion to be taught;</p>
 <p>But suffer not excess of liberality to neutralize thy mental independence.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">The</span> faults and follies of most men make their deaths a gain:</p>
 <p>But thou also art a man, full of faults and follies:</p>
 <p>Therefore sorrow for the dead, or none shall weep for thee,</p>
 <p>For the measure of charity thou dealest, shall be poured into thine own bosom.</p>
 <p>That which vexeth thee now, provoking thee to hate thy brother,</p>
 <p>Bear with it; the annoyance passeth, and may not return for ever:</p>
 <p>The same combinations and results which aggravate thy soul to-day,</p>
 <p>May not meet again for centuries in the kaleidoscope of circumstance;</p>
 <p>For men and matters change, new elements mixing in continually,</p>
 <p>And, as with chemical magic, the sour is transmuted into sweetness:</p>
 <p>A little explained, a little endured, a little passed over as a foible,</p>
 <p>And lo, the jagged atoms fit like smooth mosaic.</p>
 <p>Thou canst not shape another's mind to suit thine own body,</p>
 <p>Think not, then, to be furnishing his brain with thy special notions.</p>
 <p>Charity walketh with a high step, and stumbleth not at a trifle:</p>
 <p>Charity hath keen eyes, but the lashes half conceal them:</p>
 <p>Charity is praised of all, and fear not thou that praise,</p>
 <p>God will not love thee less, because men love thee more.</p>

<h3>OF SORROW.</h3>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="upper-case">I said,</span> I will seek out Sorrow, and minister the balm of pity;</p>
 <p>So I sought her in the house of mourning; but peace followed in her train.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
 <p>Then I marked her brooding silently in the gloomy cavern of Regret;</p>
 <p>But a sunbeam of heavenly hope gleamed on her folded wing.</p>
 <p>So I turned to the cabin of the poor, where famine dwelt with disease:</p>
 <p>But the bed of the sick was smoothed, and the ploughman whistled at his labour.</p>
 <p>So I stopt, and mused within myself, to remember where Sorrow dwelt,</p>
 <p>For I sought to see her alone, uncomforted, uncompanioned.</p>
 <p>I went to the prison, but penitence was there, and promise of better times;</p>
 <p>I listened at the madman's cell, but it echoed with deluded laughter.</p>
 <p>Then I turned me to the rich and noble; I noted the sons of fashion:</p>
 <p>A smile was on the languid cheek, that had no commerce with the heart;</p>
 <p>Unhallowed thoughts, like fires, gleamed from the window of the eye;</p>
 <p>And sorrow lived with those whose pleasures add unto their sins.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">His</span> infancy wanted not guilt; his life was continued evil:</p>
 <p>He drew in pride with his mother's milk, and a father's lips taught him cursing.</p>
 <p>I marked him as the wayward boy; I traced the dissolute youth:</p>
 <p>I saw him betray the innocent, and sacrifice affection to his lust;</p>
 <p>I saw him the companion of knaves, and a squanderer of ill-got gain;</p>
 <p>I heard him curse his own misery, while he hugged the chains that galled him:</p>
 <p>For well had experience declared the bitterness of guilty pleasure,</p>
 <p>But habit, with its iron net, involved him in its folds.</p>
 <p>Behind him lowered the thunder-storm, which the caldron of his wickedness had brewed;</p>
 <p>Before him was the smooth steep cliff, whose base is ruin and despair.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">{183}</a></span>
 <p>So he rushed madly on, and tried to forget his being:</p>
 <p>The noisy revel and the low debauch, and fierce excitement of play,</p>
 <p>With dreary interchange of palling pleasures, filled the dull round of existence:</p>
 <p>Memory was to him as a foe, so he flew for false solace to the wine-cup,</p>
 <p>And stunned his enemy at even; but she rent him as a giant in the morning.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">I turned</span> aside to weep; I lost him a little while:</p>
 <p>I looked, and years had past; he was hoar with the winter of his age.</p>
 <p>And what was now his hope? where was the balm for his sadness?</p>
 <p>The memory of the past was guilt: the feeling of the present, remorse.</p>
 <p>Then he set his affections on gold, he worshipped the shrine of Mammon,</p>
 <p>And to lay richer gifts before his idol, he starved his own bowels;</p>
 <p>So, the youth spent in profligacy ended in the gripings of want:</p>
 <p>The miser grudged himself husks to take deeper vengeance of the prodigal.</p>
 <p>And I said, this is Sorrow, but pity cannot reach it;</p>
 <p>This is to be wretched indeed, to be guilty without repentance.</p>

<h3>OF JOY.</h3>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="upper-case">My</span> soul was sickened within me, so I sought the dwelling place of Joy:</p>
 <p>And I met it not in laughter; I found it not in wealth or power;</p>
 <p>But I saw it in the pleasant home, where religion smiled upon content,</p>
 <p>And the satisfied ambition of the heart rejoiced in the favour of its God.</p>
 <p>Behold the happy man, his face is rayed with pleasure,</p>
 <p>His thoughts are of calm delight, and none can know his blessedness.</p>
 <p>I have watched him from his infancy, and seen him in the grasp of death,</p>
 <p>Yet, never have I noted on his brow the cloud of desponding sorrow.</p>
 <p>He hath knelt beside his cradle; his mother's hymn lulled him to sleep:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
 <p>In childhood he hath loved holiness, and drank from that fountain-head of peace.</p>
 <p>Wisdom took him for her scholar, guiding his steps in purity:</p>
 <p>He lived unpolluted by the world; and his young heart hated sin.</p>
 <p>But he owned not the spurious religion engendered of faction and moroseness,</p>
 <p>Neither were the sproutings of his soul seared by the brand of superstition.</p>
 <p>His love is pure and single, sincere, and knoweth not change;</p>
 <p>For his manhood hath been blest with the pleasant choice of his youth:</p>
 <p>Behold his one beloved, she leaneth on his arm,</p>
 <p>And he looketh on the years that are past, to review the dawn of her affection.</p>
 <p>Memory is sweet unto him, as a perfect landscape to the sight;</p>
 <p>Each object is lovely in itself, but the whole is the harmony of nature.</p>
 <p>Behold his little ones around him, they bask in the warmth of his smile,</p>
 <p>And infant innocence and joy lighten their happy faces;</p>
 <p>He is holy, and they honour him: he is loving, and they love him:</p>
 <p>He is consistent, and they esteem him: he is firm, and they fear him.</p>
 <p>His friends are the excellent among men; and the bands of their friendship are strong:</p>
 <p>His house is the palace of peace: for the Prince of Peace is there.</p>
 <p>As the wearied man to his couch, as the thoughtful man to his musings,</p>
 <p>Even so, from the bustle of life, he goeth to his well-ordered home.</p>
 <p>And though he often sin, he returneth with weeping eyes:</p>
 <p>For he feeleth the mercies of forgiveness, and gloweth with warmer gratitude.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> did he walk in happiness, and sorrow was a stranger to his soul;</p>
 <p>The light of affection sunned his heart, the tear of the grateful bedewed his feet,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span>
 <p>He put his hand with constancy to good, and angels knew him as a brother,</p>
 <p>And the busy satellites of evil trembled as at God's ally:</p>
 <p>He used his wealth as a wise steward, making him friends for futurity:</p>
 <p>He bent his learning to religion, and religion was with him at the last:</p>
 <p>For I saw him after many days, when the time of his release was come,</p>
 <p>And I longed for a congregated world, to behold that dying saint.</p>
 <p>As the aloe is green and well-liking, till the last best summer of its age,</p>
 <p>And then hangeth out its golden bells, to mingle glory with corruption;</p>
 <p>As a meteor travelleth in splendour, but bursteth in dazzling light;</p>
 <p>Such was the end of the righteous: his death was the sun at its setting.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Look</span> on this picture of joy, and remember that portrait of sorrow:</p>
 <p>Behold the beauty of holiness, behold the deformity of sin!</p>
 <p>How long, ye sons of men, will ye scorn the words of wisdom?</p>
 <p>How long will ye hunt for happiness in the caverns that breed despair?</p>
 <p>Will ye comfort yourselves in misery, by denying the existence of delight,</p>
 <p>And from experience in woe, will ye reason that none are happy?</p>
 <p>Joy is not in your path, for it loveth not that bleak broad road,</p>
 <p>But its flowers are hung upon the hedges that line a narrower way;</p>
 <p>And there the faint travellers of earth may wander and gather for themselves,</p>
 <p>To soothe their wounded hearts with balm from the amaranths of heaven.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY.</h3>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="upper-case">Come</span> again, and greet me as a friend, fellow-pilgrim upon life's highway,</p>
 <p>Leave awhile the hot and dusty road, to loiter in the greenwood of Reflection.</p>
 <p>Come unto my cool dim grotto, that is watered by the rivulet of truth,</p>
 <p>And over whose time-stained rock climb the fairy flowers of content;</p>
 <p>Here, upon this mossy bank of leisure fling thy load of cares,</p>
 <p>Taste my simple store, and rest one soothing hour.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span>
 <p><span class="smcap">Behold,</span> I would count thee for a brother, and commune with thy charitable soul;</p>
 <p>Though wrapt within the mantle of a prophet, I stand mine own weak scholar.</p>
 <p>Heed no disciple for a teacher, if knowledge be not found upon his tongue;</p>
 <p>For vanity and folly were the lessons these lips untaught could give:</p>
 <p>The precious staple of my merchandise cometh from a better country,</p>
 <p>The harvest of my reaping sprang of foreign seed:</p>
 <p>And this poor pensioner of Mercy&mdash;should he boast of merit?</p>
 <p>The grafted stock,&mdash;should that be proud of apples not its own?</p>
 <p>Into the bubbling brook I dip my hermit shell;</p>
 <p>Man receiveth as a cup, but Wisdom is the river.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Moreover,</span> for this fillagree of fancy, this Oriental garnish of similitude,</p>
 <p>Alas, the world is old,&mdash;and all things old within it:</p>
 <p>I walk a trodden path, I love the good old ways;</p>
 <p>Prophets, and priests, and kings have tuned the harp I faintly touch.</p>
 <p>Truth, in a garment of the past, is my choice and simple theme;</p>
 <p>No truth is new to-day: and the mantle was another's.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Still,</span> there is an insect swarm, the buzzing cloud of imagery,</p>
 <p>Mote-like steaming on my sight, and thronging my reluctant mind;</p>
 <p>The memories of studious culling, and multiplied analogies of nature,</p>
 <p>Fresh feelings unrepressed, welling from the heart spontaneous,</p>
 <p>Facts, and comparisons, and meditative atoms, gathered on the heap of combination,</p>
 <p>Mingle in the fashion of my speech with gossamer dreams of Reverie.</p>
 <p>I need not beat the underwood for game; my pheasants flock upon the lawn,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
 <p>And gamboling hares disport fearless in my dewy field;</p>
 <p>I roam no heath-empurpled hills, wearily watching for a covey,</p>
 <p>But thoughts fly swift to my decoy, eager to be caught;</p>
 <p>I sit no quiet angler, lingering patiently for sport,</p>
 <p>But spread my nets for a draught, and take the glittering shoal;</p>
 <p>I chase no solitary stag, tracking it with breathless toil,</p>
 <p>But hunt with Aurung-zebe, and spear surrounded thousands.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">What</span> then,&mdash;count ye this a boast?&mdash;sweet charity, think it other,</p>
 <p>For the dog-fish and poisonous ray are captured in the mullet-haul:</p>
 <p>The crane and the kite are of my thoughts, alike with the partridge and the quail,</p>
 <p>And unclean meats as of the clean hang upon my Seric shambles.</p>
 &mdash;How saith he? shall a man deceive, dressing up his jackal as a lion?
 <p>Or colour in staid hues of fact the changing vest of falsehood?&mdash;</p>
 <p>Brother, unwittingly he may; doubtless, unwillingly he doth:</p>
 <p>For men are full of fault, and how should he be righteous?</p>
 <p>Carefully my garden hath been weeded, yet shall it be foul with thistle;</p>
 <p>My grapery is diligently thinned, and yet many berries will be sour:</p>
 <p>From my nets have I flung the bad away, to my small skill and caution;</p>
 <p>Yet may some slimy snake have counted for an eel.</p>
 <p>The rudder of Man's best hope cannot always steer himself from error;</p>
 <p>The arrow of Man's straightest aim flieth short of truth.</p>
 <p>Thus, the confession of sincerity visit not as if it were presumption:</p>
 <p>Nor own me for a leader, where thy reason is not guide.</p>

<h3>OF CHEERFULNESS.</h3>

<div class="image-left">
  <img width="81" height="228" alt="" src="images/image67cr.jpg" />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Take</span>
 courage, prisoner of time, for there be many comforts,</p>
 <p>Cease thy labour in the pit, and bask awhile with truants in the sun;</p>
 <p>Be cheerful, man of care, for great is the multitude of chances,</p>
 <p>Burst thy fetters of anxiety, and walk among the citizens of ease:</p>
 <p>Wherefore dost thou doubt? if present good is round thee,</p>
 <p>It may be well to look for change, but to trust in a continuance is better;</p>
 <p>Whilst, at the crisis of adversity, to hope for some amends were wisdom,</p>
 <p>And cheerfully to bear thy cross in patient strength is duty.</p>
 <p>I speak of common troubles, and the petty plagues of life,</p>
 <p>The phantom-spies of Unbelief, that lurk about his outposts:</p>
 <p>Sharp suspicion, dull distrust, and sullen stern moroseness</p>
 <p>Are captains in that locust swarm to lead the cloudy host.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
 <p>Thou hast need of fortitude and faith, for the adversaries come on thickly,</p>
 <p>And he that fled hath added wings to his pursuing foes;</p>
 <p>Fight them, and the cravens flee; thy boldness is their panic;</p>
 <p>Fear them, and thy treacherous heart hath lent the ranks a legion:</p>
 <p>Among their shouts of victory resoundeth the wail of Heraclitus,</p>
 <p>While Democrite, confident and cheerful, hath plucked up the standard of their camp.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Not</span> few nor light are the burdens of life; then load it not with heaviness of spirit;</p>
 <p>Sicknesses, and penury, and travail,&mdash;there be real ills enow:</p>
 <p>We are wandering benighted, with a waning moon; plunge not rashly into jungles,</p>
 <p>Where cold and poisonous damps will quench the torch of hope:</p>
 <p>The tide is strong against us; good oarsmen, pull or perish,&mdash;</p>
 <p>If your arms be slack for fear, ye shall not stem the torrent.</p>
 <p>A wise traveller goeth on cheerily, through fair weather or foul;</p>
 <p>He knoweth that his journey must be sped, so he carrieth his sunshine with him.</p>
 <p>Calamities come not as a curse,&mdash;nor prosperity for other than a trial;</p>
 <p>Struggle,&mdash;thou art better for the strife, and the very energy shall hearten thee.</p>
 <p>Good is taught in a Spartan school,&mdash;hard lessons and a rough discipline;</p>
 <p>But evil cometh idly of itself, in the luxury of Capuan holidays:</p>
 <p>And Wisdom will go bravely forth to meet the chastening scourge,</p>
 <p>Enduring with a thankful heart that punishment of Love.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">There</span> be three chief rivers of despondency: sin, sorrow, fear;</p>
 <p>Sin is the deepest, sorrow hath its shallows, and fear is a noisy rapid:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
 <p>But even to the darkest holes in guilt's profoundest river</p>
 <p>Hope can pierce with quickening ray, and all those depths are lightened.</p>
 <p>So long as there is mercy in a God, hope is the privilege of creatures,</p>
 <p>And so soon as there is penitence in creatures, that hope is exalted into duty.</p>
 <p>Verily, consider this for courage; that the fearful and the unbelieving</p>
 <p>Are classed with idolaters and liars, because they trusted not in God:</p>
 <p>For it is none other than selfish sin, a hard and proud ingratitude,</p>
 <p>Where seeming repentance is herald of despair, instead of hope's forerunner.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Moreover,</span> in thy day of grief,&mdash;for friends, or fame, or fortune,</p>
 <p>Well I wot the heart shall ache, and mind be numbed in torpor;</p>
 <p>Let nature weep; leave her alone; the freshet of her sorrow must run off;</p>
 <p>And sooner will the lake be clear, relieved of turbid floodings.</p>
 <p>Yet see that her license hath a limit; with the novelty her agony is over;</p>
 <p>Hasten in that earliest calm, to tie her in the leash with Reason.</p>
 <p>For regrets are an enervating folly, and the season for energy is come,</p>
 <p>Yea rather, that the future may repair with diligence the ruins of the past.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Again,</span> for empty fears, the harassings of possible calamity,</p>
 <p>Pray, and thou shalt prosper; trust in God, and tread them down.</p>
 <p>Yield to the phantasy,&mdash;thou sinnest; resist it, He will aid thee:</p>
 <p>Out of Him there is no help, nor any sober courage.</p>
 <p>Feeble is the comfort of the faithless, a man without a God;</p>
 <p>Who dare counsel such an one to fling away his fears?</p>
 <p>Fear is the heritage of him, a portion wise and merciful,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
 <p>To drive the trembler into safety, if haply he may turn and flee:</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, let him reckon an he will, that all be counteth casual</p>
 <p>May as well be for him as against him; dice have many sides:</p>
 <p>And, even as in ailments of the body, diseases follow closely upon dreads,</p>
 <p>So, with infirmities of mind, is fear the pallid harbinger of failure.</p>
 <p>It were wise to walk undaunted even in an accidental chaos,</p>
 <p>For the brave man is at peace, and free to get the mastery of circumstance.</p>
 <p>The stoutest armour of defence is that which is worn within the bosom,</p>
 <p>And the weapon that no enemy can parry, is a bold and cheerful spirit:</p>
 <p>Catapults in old war worked like Titans, crushing foes with rocks;</p>
 <p>So doth a strong-springed heart throw back every load on its assailants.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">I went</span> heavily for cares, and fell into the trance of sorrow;</p>
 <p>And behold, a vision in my trance, and my ministering angel brought it.</p>
 <p>There stood a mountain huge and steep, the awful Rock of Ages;</p>
 <p>The sun upon its summit, and storms midway, and deep ravines at foot.</p>
 <p>And, as I looked, a dense black cloud, suddenly dropping from the thunder,</p>
 <p>Filled, like a cataract with yeasty foam, a narrow smiling valley:</p>
 <p>Close and hard that vaporous mass seemed to press the ground,</p>
 <p>And lamentable sounds came up, as of some that were smothering beneath.</p>
 <p>Then, as I walked upon the mountain, clear in summer's noon,</p>
 <p>For charity I called aloud, Ho! climb up hither to the sunshine.</p>
 <p>And even like a stream of light my voice had pierced the mist;</p>
 <p>I saw below two families of men, and knew their names of old:</p>
 <p>Courage, struggling through the darkness, stout of heart and gladsome,</p>
 <p>Ran up the shining ladder which the voice of Hope had made;</p>
 <p>And tripping lightly by his side, a sweet-eyed helpmate with him,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
 <p>I looked upon her face to welcome pleasant Cheerfulness;</p>
 <p>And a babe was cradled in her bosom, a laughing little prattler,</p>
 <p>The child of Cheerfulness and Courage,&mdash;could his name be other than Success?</p>
 <p>So, from his happy wife, when they both stood beside me on the mountain,</p>
 <p>The fond father took that babe, and set him on his shoulder in the sunshine.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Again</span> I peered into the valley, for I heard a gasping moan,</p>
 <p>A desolate weak cry, as muffled in the vapours.</p>
 <p>So down that crystal shaft into the poisonous mine</p>
 <p>I sped for charity to seek and save,&mdash;and those I sought fled from me.</p>
 <p>At length, I spied, far distant, a trembling withered dwarf</p>
 <p>Who crouched beneath the cloak of a tall and spectral mourner:</p>
 <p>Then I knew Cowardice and Gloom, and followed them on in darkness,</p>
 <p>Guided by their rustling robes and moans and muffled cries,</p>
 <p>Until in a suffocating pit the wretched pair had perished,&mdash;</p>
 <p>And lo, their whitening bones were shaping out an epitaph of Failure.</p>

<h3>OF YESTERDAY.</h3>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="upper-case">Speak,</span> poor almsman of to-day, whom none can assure of a to-morrow,</p>
 <p>Tell out, with honest heart, the price thou settest upon yesterday.</p>
 <p>Is it then a writing in the dust, traced by the finger of idleness,</p>
 <p>Which Industry, clean housewife, can wipe away for ever?</p>
 <p>Is it as a furrow on the sand, fashioned by the toying waves,</p>
 <p>Quickly to be trampled then again by the feet of the returning tide?</p>
 <p>Is it as the pale blue smoke, rising from a peasant's hovel,</p>
 <p>That melted into limpid air, before it topped the larches?</p>
 <p>Is it but a vision, unstable and unreal, which wise men soon forget?</p>
 <p>Is it as the stranger of a night,&mdash;gone, we heed not whither?</p>
 <p>Alas! thou foolish heart, whose thoughts are but as these,</p>
 <p>Alas! deluded soul, that hopeth thus of Yesterday.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">For,</span> behold,&mdash;those temples of Ellora, the Brahmin's rock-built shrine,</p>
 <p>Behold&mdash;yon granite cliff, which the North Sea buffeteth in vain,&mdash;</p>
 <p>That stout old forest fir,&mdash;these waking verities of life,</p>
 <p>This guest abiding ever, not strange, nor a servant, but a son,&mdash;</p>
 <p>Such, O man, are vanity and dreams, transient as a rainbow on the cloud,</p>
 <p>Weighed against that solid fact, thine ill-remembered Yesterday.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span>
 <p>Eagerly the village school-boys cluster on the tightened rope,</p>
 <p>Shouting, and bending to the pull, or lifted from the ground elastic;</p>
 <p>The huge tree boweth like Sisera, boweth to its foes with faintness,&mdash;</p>
 <p>Its sinews crack,&mdash;deep groans declare the reeling anguish of Goliath,</p>
 <p>The wedge is driven home,&mdash;and the saw is at its heart,&mdash;and lo, with solemn slowness,</p>
 <p>The shuddering monarch riseth from his throne,&mdash;toppled with a crash,&mdash;and is fallen!</p>

 <p><span class="smcap">Now</span> shall the mangled stump teach proud man a lesson:</p>
 <p>Now, can we from that elm-tree's sap distil the wine of Truth.</p>
 <p>Heed ye those hundred rings, concentric from the core,</p>
 <p>Eddying in various waves to the red bark's shore-like rim?</p>
 <p>These be the gatherings of yesterdays, present all to-day,</p>
 <p>This is the tree's judgment, self-history that cannot be gainsaid:</p>
 <p>Seven years agone there was a drought,&mdash;and the seventh ring is narrowed;</p>
 <p>The fifth from hence was half a deluge,&mdash;the fifth is cellular and broad.</p>
 <p>Thus, Man, thou art a result, the growth of many yesterdays,</p>
 <p>That stamp thy secret soul with marks of weal or woe:</p>
 <p>Thou art an almanack of self, the living record of thy deeds;</p>
 <p>Spirit hath its scars as well as body, sore and aching in their season:</p>
 <p>Here is a knot,&mdash;it was a crime; there is a canker,&mdash;selfishness;</p>
 <p>Lo, here, the heart-wood rotten; lo, there, perchance, the sap-wood sound.</p>
 <p>Nature teacheth not in vain; thy works are in thee, of thee;</p>
 <p>Some present evil bent hath grown of older errors:</p>
 <p>And what if thou be walking now uprightly? Salve not thy wounds with poison,</p>
 <p>As if a petty goodness of to-day hath blotted out the sin of yesterday:</p>
 <p>It is well, thou hast life and light; and the Hewer showeth mercy,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></span>
 <p>Dressing the root, pruning the branch, and looking for thy tardy fruits;</p>
 <p>But, even here as thou standest, cheerful belike and careless,</p>
 <p>The stains of ancient evil are upon thee, the record of thy wrong is in thee:</p>
 <p>For, a curse of many yesterdays is thine, many yesterdays of sin,</p>
 <p>That, haply heeded little now, shall blast thy many morrows.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Shall</span> then a man reck nothing, but hurl mad defiance at his Judge,</p>

 <p>He ought,&mdash;so Satan spake; he must,&mdash;so Atheism urgeth;</p>
 <p>He may,&mdash;it was the libertine's thought; he doth,&mdash;the bad world said it.</p>
 <p>But thou of humbler heart, thou student wiser for simplicity,</p>
 <p>While Nature warneth thee betimes, heed the loving counsel of Religion.</p>
 <p>True, this change is good, and penitence most precious;</p>
 <p>But trust not thou thy change, nor rest upon repentance:</p>
 <p>For all we are corrupted at the core, smooth as surface seemeth;</p>
 <p>What health can bloom in a beautiful skin, when rottenness hath fed upon the bones?</p>
 <p>And guilt is parcel of us all; not thou, sweet nursling of affection,</p>
 <p>Art spotless, though so passing fair,&mdash;nor thou, mild patriarch of virtue.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Behold</span> then the better Tree of Life, free unto us all for grafting,</p>
 <p>Cut thee from the hollow root of self, to be budded on a richer Vine.</p>
 <p>Be desperate, O man, as of evil, so of good; tear that tunic from thee;</p>
 <p>The past can never be retrieved, be the present what it may.</p>
 <p>Vain is the penance and the scourge, vain the fast and vigil:</p>
 <p>The fencer's cautious skill to-day, can this erase his scars?</p>
 <p>It is Man's to famish as a faquir, it is Man's to die a devotee,</p>
 <p>Light is the torture and the toil, balanced with the wages of Eternity:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>
 <p>But, it is God's to yearn in love, on the humblest, the poorest, and the worst,</p>
 <p>For He giveth freely, as a king, asking only thanks for mercy.</p>
 <p>Look upon this noble-hearted Substitute; seeing thy woes, He pitied thee,</p>
 <p>Bowed beneath the mountain of thy sin, and perished,&mdash;but for Godhead;</p>
 <p>There stood the Atlas in his power, and Prometheus in his love is there,</p>
 <p>Emptying on wretched men the blessings earned from Heaven:</p>
 <p>Put them not away, hide them in thy heart, poor and penitent receiver,</p>
 <p>Be gratitude thy counseller to good, and wholesome fear unto obedience;</p>
 <p>Remember, the pruning-knife is keen, cutting cankers even from the vine;</p>
 <p>Remember, twelve were chosen, and one among them liveth&mdash;in perdition.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Yea,&mdash;</span>for standing unatoned, the soul is a bison on the prairie,</p>

 <p>The pebble that must add one more to those pursuing ghosts.</p>
 <p>O man, there is a storm behind should drive thy bark to haven;</p>
 <p>The foe, the foe is on thy track, patient, certain, and avenging;</p>
 <p>Day by day, solemnly, and silently, followeth the fearful past,&mdash;</p>
 <p>His step is lame, but sure; for he catcheth the present in eternity:</p>
 <p>And how to escape that foe, the present-past in future?</p>
 <p>How to avert that fate, living consequence of causes unexistent?&mdash;</p>
 <p>Boldly we must overleap his birth, and date above his memories,</p>
 <p>Grafted on the living Tree, that <small>WAS</small> before a yesterday:</p>
 <p>No refuge of a younger birth than one that saw creation</p>
 <p>Can hide the child of time from still condemning Yesterday.</p>
 <p>There, is the Sanctuary-city, mocking at the wrath of thine Avenger,</p>
 <p>Close at hand, with the wicket on the latch; haste for thy life, poor hunted one!</p>

 <p>Fly, thy sword is broken at the hilt; fly, thy shield is shivered;</p>
 <p>Leap the barriers, and baffle him: the arena of the past is his.</p>
 <p>The bounds of Guilt are the cycles of Time: thou must be safe within Eternity;</p>
 <p>The arms of God alone shall rescue thee from Yesterday.</p>

 <p>Who, now, degraded and in exile, having sold their fatherland for nought,</p>
 <p>Sink and are extinguished in the western seas, even as the sun they follow,&mdash;</p>

 <p>Nestor's wisdom, the chivalry of Manlius, the native eloquence of Cicero,</p>

 <p>The poem, is it not a fabric of mind? we love what we create:</p>

 <p>Yea, when the volume of the universe was blazoned out in beauty by its Author,</p>
 <p>God was glad, and blessed His work; for it was very good.</p>

 <p>Hath taught it in the whisperings of wisdom, and added all the riches of content:</p>
 <p>Therefore, leaning on his God, a pensioner for soul and body,</p>
 <p>His spirit is the subject of none other, calling no man Master.</p>
 <p>His hopes are mighty and eternal, scorning small ambitions:</p>
 <p>He hideth from the pettiness of praise, and pitieth the feebleness of envy.</p>
 <p>If he meet honours, well; it may be his humility to take them:</p>
 <p>If he be rebuked, better; his veriest enemy shall teach him.</p>
 <p>For the master-mind hath a birthright of eminence; his cradle is an eagle's eyrie:</p>

 <p>What, if the prophet lacketh honour? for he can spare that praise:</p>
 <p>The honest giant careth not to be patted on the back by pigmies;</p>
 <p>Flatter greatness, he brooketh it good-humouredly: blame him,&mdash;thou tiltest at a pyramid:</p>

 <p>If aught he heedeth in the matter, his honour is sought in their neglect.</p>
 <p>Slender is the marvel, and little is the glory, when round his luscious fruits</p>
 <p>The worm and the wasp and the multitude of flies are gathered as to banquet;</p>
 <p>Fashion's freak, and the critical sting, and the flood of flatteries he scorneth;</p>
 <p>Cheerfully asking of the crowd the favour to forget him:</p>
 <p>The while his blooming fruits ripen in richer fragrance,</p>
 <p>A feast for the few,&mdash;and the many yet unborn,&mdash;who still shall love their savour.</p>

 <p>His children's children shall talk of him in love, and teach their sons his honour:</p>
 <p>His dignity hath set him among princes, the universe is debtor to his worth,</p>
 <p>His privilege is blessing for ever, his happiness shineth now,</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">All</span>
 things being are in mystery; we expound mysteries by mysteries;</p>
 <p>And yet the secret of them all is one in simple grandeur:</p>
 <p>All intricate, yet each path plain, to those who know the way;</p>
 <p>All unapproachable, yet easy of access, to them that hold the key:</p>
 <p>We walk among labyrinths of wonder, but thread the mazes with a clue;</p>
 <p>We sail in chartless seas, but behold! the pole-star is above us.</p>
 <p>For, counting down from God's good will, thou meltest every riddle into Him,</p>
 <p>The axiom of reason is an undiscovered God, and all things live in His ubiquity:</p>
 <p>There is only one great secret; but that one hideth everywhere;</p>
 <p>How should the infinite be understood in Time, when it stretcheth on ungrasped for ever?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span>
 <p>Can a halting &OElig;dipus of earth guess that enigma of the universe?</p>
 <p>Not one: the sword of faith must cut the Gordian knot of nature.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">God,</span> pervading all, is in all things the mystery of each;</p>
 <p>The wherefore of its character and essence, the fountain of its virtues and its beauties.</p>
 <p>The child asketh of its mother,&mdash;Wherefore is the violet so sweet?</p>
 <p>The mother answereth her babe,&mdash;Darling, God hath willed it.</p>
 <p>And sages, diving into science, have but a profundity of words;</p>
 <p>They track for some few links the circling chain of consequence,</p>
 <p>And then, after doubts and disputations, are left where they began,</p>
 <p>At the bald conclusion of a clown, things are because they are.</p>
 <p>Wherefore are the meadows green, is it not to gratify the eye?</p>
 <p>But why should greenness charm the eye? such is God's good will.</p>
 <p>Wherefore is the ear attuned to a pleasure in musical sounds,</p>
 <p>And who set a number to those sounds, and fixed the laws of harmony?</p>
 <p>Who taught the bird to build its nest, or lent the shrub its life,</p>
 <p>Or poised in the balances of order the power to attract and to repel?</p>
 <p>Who continueth the worlds, and the sea, and the heart, in motion?</p>
 <p>Who commanded gravitation to tie down all upon its sphere?&mdash;</p>
 <p>For, even as a limestone cliff is an aggregate of countless shells,</p>
 <p>One riddle concrete of many, a mystery compact of mysteries,</p>
 <p>So God, cloud-capped in immensity, standeth the cohesion of all things,</p>
 <p>And secrets, sublimely indistinct, permeate that Universe, Himself;</p>
 <p>As is the whole, so are the parts, whether they be mighty or minute,</p>
 <p>The sun is not more unexplained than the tissue of an emmet's wing.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> then, omnipresent Deity worketh His unbiassed mind,</p>
 <p>A mind, one in moral, but infinitely multiplied in means:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
 <p>And the uniform prudence of His will cometh to be counted law,</p>
 <p>Till mutable man fancieth volition stirring in the potter's clay:</p>
 <p>God, a wise father, showeth not His reasons to His babes;</p>
 <p>But willeth in secresy and goodness: for causes generate dispute:</p>
 <p>Then we, His darkling children, watch that invariable purpose,</p>
 <p>And invest the passive creature with its Maker's energy and skill:</p>
 <p>Therefore, they of old time stopped short of God in idols,</p>
 <p>Therefore, in these latter days, we heed not the Jehovah in His works.</p>
 <p>Mystery is God's great name; He is the mystery of goodness:</p>
 <p>Some other, from the hierarchs of heaven, usurped the mystery of sin.</p>
 <p>God is the King, yea even of Himself; He crowned Himself with holiness;</p>
 <p>The burning circlet of iniquity another found and wore.</p>
 <p>God is separate, even from His attributes; but He willed eternally the good;</p>
 <p>Therefore freely, though unchangeably, is wise, righteous, and loving:</p>
 <p>But ambition, open unto angels, saw the evil, flung aside from the beginning,</p>
 <p>It was Lucifer that saw, and nothing loathed those black unclaimed regalia,</p>
 <p>So he coveted and stole, to be counted for a king, antagonist of God,</p>
 <p>But when he touched the leprous robes, behold! a cheated traitor.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">For</span> self-existence, charactered with love, with power, wisdom, and ubiquity,</p>

 <p>And beings living on His breath, were needfully less perfect than Himself,</p>
 <p>Therefore less capable of bliss, whereat His benevolence was bounded;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
 <p>So, to make the capability expand, intensely progressive to eternity,</p>
 <p>He suffered darkness to illustrate the light, and pain to heighten pleasure:</p>
 <p>To heap up happiness on souls He loved, allowed He sin and sorrow,</p>
 <p>And then to guilt and grief and shame, He brought unbidden amnesty:</p>
 <p>Sinless, none had been redeemed, nor wrapt again in God:</p>
 <p>Sorrowless, no conflict had been known, and Heaven had been mulcted of its comfort:</p>
 <p>Yea, with evil unexhibited, probationary toils unfelt,</p>
 <p>Men had not appreciated good, nor angels valued their security.</p>
 <p>Herein, to reason's eye, is revealed the mystery of goodness,</p>
 <p>Blessing through permitted woe, and teaching by the mystery of sin.</p>

 <p>Toiling feebly upward, their argument tracketh from below,</p>

 <p>What is this? that a seed produced a seed, and so for a thousand seasons;</p>
 <p>Ascend a thousand steps, thy ladder leaveth thee in air:</p>
 <p>Thou canst not climb to God, and short of Him is nothing;</p>
 <p>There is no cause for aught we see, but in His present will.</p>
 <p>Begin from the Maker, thou carriest down His attributes to reptiles,</p>
 <p>The sharded beetle and the lizard live and move in Him:</p>
 <p>Begin from the creature, corruption and infirmity mar thy foolish toil,</p>
 <p>Heap Ossa on Olympus, how much art thou nearer to the stars?</p>
 <p>It is easy running from a mountain's top down to the valleys at its foot,</p>
 <p>But difficult and steep the laborious ascent, and feebly shalt thou reach it:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">{223}</a></span>
 <p>Yet man, beginning from himself, that first deluding mystery,</p>
 <p>Hopeth from the pit of lies to struggle up to truth;</p>
 <p>So, taxing knowledge to its strength, he pusheth one step further,</p>
 <p>And fancieth complacently that much is done by reaching a remote effect:</p>
 <p>Then he maketh answer to himself, as a silly nurse to her little one,</p>
 <p>Evading, in a mist of words, hard things he cannot solve;</p>
 <p>Till, like an ostrich in the desert, he burieth his head in atoms,</p>

 <p>The captious and cautious unbeliever is of all men weakest to believe:</p>
 <p>Cut from the anchorage of God, his bark is a plaything of the billows;</p>
 <p>The compass of his principle is broken, the rudder of his faith unshipped:</p>
 <p>Chance and Fate, in a stultified antagonism, govern all for him;</p>
 <p>Truth sprang from the conflict of falsities, and the multitude of accidents hath bred design!</p>
 <p>Where is the imposture so gross, that shall not entrap his curiosity?</p>
 <p>What superstition is so abject, that it doth not blanch his cheek?</p>
 <p>Whereof can he be sure, with whom Chaos is substitute for Order?</p>
 <p>How should his silly structure stand, a pyramid built upon its apex?&mdash;</p>

 <p>There is a solitary pride, when the heart, in new importance,</p>
 <p>Writeth gladly on its archives, the secrets none other men have seen:</p>
 <p>And there is a caged terror, evermore wrestling with the mind,</p>
 <p>When crime hath whispered his confession, and the secrets are written there in blood:</p>
 <p>The village maiden is elated at the tenderly confided tale:</p>
 <p>The bandit's wife with sickening fear guessed the premeditated murder:</p>

 <p>And where a darling child hath died, give praise, and hope, and sympathy.</p>
 <p>Yet once more, heed thou this; give to the poor discreetly,</p>
 <p>Nor suffer idle sloth to lean upon thy charitable arm:</p>
 <p>To diligence give, as to an equal, on just and fit occasion;</p>
 <p>Or he bartereth his hard-earned self-reliance for the casual lottery of gifts.</p>
 <p>The timely loan hath added nerve, where easy liberality would palsy;</p>
 <p>Work and wages make a light heart; but the mendicant asked with a heavy spirit.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">{229}</a></span>
 <p>A man's own self-respect is worth unto him more than money,</p>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">There</span> are who sow liberalities, to reap the like again;</p>

 <p>Yea, there are who give unto the poor, to gain large interest of God,&mdash;</p>
 <p>Fool,&mdash;to think His wealth is money, and not mind:</p>
 <p>And haply after thine alms, thy calculated givings,</p>

 <p><span class="smcap">Give,</span> saith the preacher, be large in liberality, yield to the holy impulse,</p>
 <p>Tarry not for cold consideration, but cheerfully and freely scatter.</p>
 <p>So, for complacency of conscience, in a gush of counterfeited charity,</p>
 <p>He that hath not wherewith to be just, selfishly presumeth to be generous:</p>
 <p>The debtor, and the rich by wrong, are known among the band of the benevolent;</p>
 <p>And men extol the noble hearts, who rob that they may give.</p>
 <p>Receivers are but little prone to challenge rights of giving,</p>
 <p>Nor stop to test, for conscience-sake, the righteousness of mammon:</p>
 <p>And the zealot in a cause is a receiver, at the hand which bettereth his cause;</p>
 <p>And thus an unsuspected bribe shall blind the good man's judgment:</p>
 <p>It is easy to excuse greatness, and the rich are readily forgiven:</p>
 <p>What, if his gains were evil, sanctified by using them aright?</p>
 <p>O shallow flatterer, self-interest is thy thought,</p>
 <p>Hopeless of partaking in the like, thou too wouldst scorn the giver.</p>

 <p>Hath small scruple whence it came: Vespasian rejoiceth in his tribute.</p>
 <p>Therefore have colleges and hospitals risen upon orphans' wrongs,</p>
 <p>Chapels and cathedrals have thriven on the welcome wages of iniquity,</p>
 <p>And fraud, in evil compensation, hath salved his guilty conscience,</p>
 <p>Not by restoring to the cheated, but by ostentatious giving to the grateful.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">So,</span> those who reap rejoice; and reaping, bless the sower:</p>
 <p>No one is eager to discover, where discovery tendeth unto loss:</p>

 <p>Therefore, O preacher, zealous for charity, temper thy warm appeal,&mdash;</p>
 <p>Warning the debtor and unjustly rich, they may not dare to give:</p>
 <p>To do good is a privilege and guerdon: how shouldst thou rejoice</p>
 <p>If ill-got gifts of presumptuous fraud be offered on the altar?</p>
 <p>The question is not of degrees; unhallowed alms are evil;</p>
 <p>Discourage and reject alike the obolus or talent of iniquity.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Yet</span> more, be careful that, unworthily, thou gain not an advantage over weakness,</p>
 <p>Unstable souls, fervent and profuse, fluttered by the feeling of the moment;</p>
 <p>For eloquence swayeth to its will the feeble and the conscious of defect:</p>
 <p>Rashly give they, and afterward are sad,&mdash;a gift that doubly erred.</p>
 <p>It was the worldliness of priestcraft that accounted alms-giving for charity;</p>
 <p>And many a father's penitence hath steeped his son in penury;</p>
 <p>Yet, considered he lightly the guilt of a death-bed selfishness</p>
 <p>That strove to take with him, for gain, the gold no longer his;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
 <p>So he died in a false peace, and dying robbed his kindred;</p>

 <p><span class="smcap">Charity</span> sitteth on a fair hill-top, blessing far and near,</p>

 <p>For her angel face is lustrous and beloved, even as the moon in heaven:</p>
 <p>But the light of that beatific vision gloweth in serener concentration</p>
 <p>The nearer to her heart, and nearer to her home,&mdash;that hill-top where she sitteth:</p>
 <p>Therefore is she kind unto her kin, yearning in affection on her neighbours,</p>
 <p>Giving gifts to those around, who know and love her well.</p>
 <p>But the counterfeit of charity, an hypocrite of earth, not a grace of heaven,</p>
 <p>Seeketh not to bless at home, for her nearer aspect is ill-favoured:</p>
 <p>Therefore hideth she for shame, counting that pride humility,</p>
 <p>And none of those around her hearth are gladdened by her gifts:</p>
 <p>Rather, with an overreaching zeal, flingeth she her bounty to the stranger,</p>
 <p>And scattered prodigalities abroad compensate for meanness in her home:</p>
 <p>For benefits showered on the distant shine in unmixed beauty,</p>
 <p>So that even she may reap their undiscerning praise:</p>
 <p>Therefore native want hath pined, where foreign need was fattened;</p>
 <p>Woman been crushed by the tyrannous hand that upheld the flag of liberality;</p>
 <p>Poverty been prisoned up and starved, by hearts that are maudlin upon crime;</p>

 <p>Yet would he bless thee and be grateful, didst thou feed his spirit,</p>
 <p>And teach him that thine alms-givings are charities, are loves:</p>

 <p>Constant in the multitude of change, and simple amidst intricate complexity.</p>
 <p>Folly's shallow lip can ask the deepest question,</p>

 <p>Strangely woven is the web, disorderly yet harmonious,</p>

 <p>It is shot with heaven's blue, the soul of summer skies,</p>
 <p>And twisted strings of light, the mind of noonday suns,</p>
 <p>And ruddy gleams of life, that roll along the veins,</p>
 <p>A coat of many colours, running curiously together.</p>
 <p>There is threefold beauty for man; twofold beauty for the animal;</p>
 <p>And the beauty of inanimates is single: body, temper, spirit.</p>
 <p>Multiplied in endless combination, issue the changeable results;</p>
 <p>Each class verging on the other twain, with imperceptible gradation;</p>
 <p>And every individual in each having his propriety of difference,</p>
 <p>So that the meanest of creation bringeth in a tribute of the beautiful.</p>
 <p>Yea, from the worst in favour shineth out a fitness of design,</p>
 <p>The patent mark of beauty, its Maker's name imprest.</p>
 <p>For the great Creator's seal is set to all His works;</p>
 <p>Its quarterings are Attributes of praise, and all the shield is Beauty:</p>
 <p>So, that heraldic blazon is Creation's common signet;</p>
 <p>And the universal family of life goeth in the colours of its Lord:</p>
 <p>But each one, as a several son, shall bear those arms with a difference;</p>
 <p>Beauty, various in phase, and similar in seeming oppositions.</p>
 <p>The coins of old Rome were struck with a diversity for each,</p>
 <p>Barely two be found alike, in every Cæsar's image:</p>
 <p>So, note thou the seals, ranged round the charters of the Universe,</p>
 <p>The finger of God is the stamp upon them all, but each hath its separate variety.</p>

 <p>And broken arches charm the sight with hints of fair completeness.</p>
 <p>So, while humbled at the ruin, be thou grateful for the relics;</p>

 <p><span class="smcap">Each</span> man hath a measure for himself, yet all shall coincide in much;</p>
 <p>A perfect form of human grace would captivate the world:</p>
 <p>Be it manhood's lustre, or the loveliness of woman, all would own its beauty,</p>
 <p>The Caffre and Circassian, Russians and Hindoos, the Briton, the Turk and Japanese.</p>
 <p>Not all alike, nor all at once, but each in proportion to intelligence,</p>
 <p>His purer state in morals, and a lesser grade in guilt:</p>
 <p>For the high standard of the beautiful is fixed in Reason's forum,</p>
 <p>And sins, and customs, and caprice, have failed to break it down:</p>
 <p>And reason's standard for the creature pointeth three perfections,</p>
 <p>Frame, knowledge, and the feeling heart, well and kindly mingled;</p>
 <p>A fair dwelling, furnished wisely, with a gentle tenant in it,&mdash;</p>
 <p>This is the glory of humanity: thou hast seen it seldom.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a beauty for the body; the superficial polish of a statue,</p>
 <p>The symmetry of form and feature delicately carved and painted.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">{244}</a></span>
 <p>How bright in early bloom the Georgian sitteth at her lattice,</p>
 <p>How softened off in graceful curves her young and gentle shape:</p>
 <p>Those dark eyes, lit by curiosity, flash beneath the lashes,</p>
 <p>And still her velvet cheek is dimpled with a smile.</p>
 <p>Dost thou count her beautiful?&mdash;even as a mere fair figure,</p>
 <p>A plastic image, little more,&mdash;the outer garb of woman:</p>
 <p>Yea,&mdash;and thus far it is well; but Reason's hopes are higher,&mdash;</p>
 <p>Can he sate his soul on a scantling third of beauty?</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Yet</span> is this the pleasing trickery, that cheateth half the world,</p>
 <p>Nature's wise deceit to make up waste in life;</p>
 <p>And few be they that rest uncaught, for many a twig is limed;</p>
 <p>Where is the wise among a million, that took not form for beauty?</p>
 <p>But watch it well; for vanity and sin, malice, hate, suspicion,</p>
 <p>Louring as clouds upon the countenance, will disenchant its charms.</p>
 <p>The needful complexity of beauty claimeth mind and soul,</p>
 <p>Though many coins of foul alloy pass current for the true:</p>
 <p>And albeit fairness in the creature shall often co-exist with excellence,</p>
 <p>Yet hath many an angel shape been tenanted by fiends.</p>
 <p>A man, spiritually keen, shall detect in surface beauty</p>
 <p>Those marring specks of evil which the sensual cannot see;</p>
 <p>Therefore is he proof against a face, unlovely to his likings,</p>
 <p>And common minds shall scorn the taste, that shrunk from sin's distortion.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a beauty for the reason; grandly independent of externals,</p>
 <p>It looketh from the windows of the house, shining in the man triumphant.</p>
 <p>I have seen the broad blank face of some misshapen dwarf</p>
 <p>Lit on a sudden as with glory, the brilliant light of mind:</p>
 <p>Who then imagined him deformed? intelligence is blazing on his forehead,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">{245}</a></span>
 <p>There is empire in his eye, and sweetness on his lip, and his brown cheek glittereth with beauty:</p>
 <p>And I have known some Nireus of the camp, a varnished paragon of chamberers,</p>
 <p>Fine, elegant, and shapely, moulded as the master-piece of Phidias,&mdash;</p>
 <p>Such an one, with intellects abased, have I noted crouching to the dwarf,</p>
 <p>Whilst his lovers scorn the fool, whose beauty hath departed!</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">And</span> there is a beauty for the spirit; mind in its perfect flowering,</p>
 <p>Fragrant, expanded into soul, full of love and blessed.</p>
 <p>Go to some squalid couch, some famishing death-bed of the poor;</p>
 <p>He is shrunken, cadaverous, diseased;&mdash;there is here no beauty of the body:</p>
 <p>Never hath he fed on knowledge, nor drank at the streams of science,</p>
 <p>He is of the common herd, illiterate;&mdash;there is here no beauty of the reason:</p>
 <p>But lo! his filming eye is bright with love from heaven,</p>
 <p>In every look it beameth praise, as worshipping with seraphs;</p>
 <p>What honeycomb is hived upon his lips, eloquent of gratitude and prayer,&mdash;</p>
 <p>What triumph shrined serene upon that clammy brow,</p>
 <p>What glory flickering transparent under those thin cheeks,&mdash;</p>
 <p>What beauty in his face!&mdash;Is it not the face of an angel?</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Now,</span> of these three, infinitely mingled and combined,</p>
 <p>Consisteth human beauty, in all the marvels of its mightiness:</p>
 <p>And forth from human beauty springeth the intensity of Love;</p>
 <p>Feeling, thought, desire, the three deep fountains of affection.</p>
 <p>Son of Adam, or daughter of Eve, art thou trapped by nature,</p>
 <p>And is thy young eye dazzled with the pleasant form of beauty?</p>
 <p>This is but a lower love; still it hath its honour;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">{246}</a></span>
 <p>What God hath made and meant to charm, let not man despise.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, as reason's child, look thou wisely farther,</p>
 <p>For age, disease, and care, and sin, shall tarnish all the surface:</p>
 <p>Reach a loftier love: be lured by the comeliness of mind,&mdash;</p>
 <p>Gentle, kind, and calm, or lustrous in the livery of knowledge.</p>
 <p>And more, there is a higher grade; force the mind to its perfection&mdash;</p>
 <p>Win those golden trophies of consummate love:</p>
 <p>Add unto riches of the reason, and a beauty moulded to thy liking,</p>
 <p>The precious things of nobler grace that well adorn a soul;</p>
 <p>Thus, be thou owner of a treasure, great in earth and heaven,</p>
 <p>Beauty, wisdom, goodness, in a creature like its God.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">So</span> then, draw we to an end; with feeble step and faltering,</p>
 <p>I follow beauty through the universe, and find her home Ubiquity:</p>
 <p>In all that God hath made, in all that man hath marred,</p>
 <p>Lingereth beauty, or its wreck, a broken mould and castings.</p>
 <p>And now, having wandered long time, freely and with desultory feet,</p>
 <p>To gather in the garden of the world a few fair sample flowers,</p>
 <p>With patient scrutinizing care let us cull the conclusion of their essence,</p>
 <p>And answer to the riddle of Zorobabel, Whence the might of beauty?</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Ugliness</span> is native unto nothing, but an attribute of concrete evil;</p>
 <p>In everything created, at its worst, lurk the dregs of loveliness:</p>
 <p>We be fallen into utter depths, yet once we stood sublime,</p>
 <p>For man was made in perfect praise, his Maker's comely image:</p>
 <p>And so his new-born ill is spiced with older good,</p>
 <p>He carrieth with him, yea to crime, the withered limbs of beauty.</p>
 <p>Passions may be crooked generosities; the robber stealeth for his children;</p>
 <p>Murder was avenger of the innocent, or wiped out shame with blood.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">{247}</a></span>
 <p>Many virtues, weighted by excess, sink among the vices;</p>
 <p>Many vices, amicably buoyed, float among the virtues.</p>
 <p>For, albeit sin is hate, a foul and bitter turpitude,</p>
 <p>As hurling back against the Giver all His gifts with insult,</p>
 <p>Still when concrete in the sinner, it will seem to partake of his attractions,</p>
 <p>And in seductive masquerade shall cloak its leprous skin;</p>
 <p>His broken lights of beauty shall illumine its utter black,</p>
 <p>And those refracted rays glitter on the hunch of its deformity.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Verily</span> the fancy may be false, yet hath it met me in my musings,</p>
 (As expounding the pleasantness of pleasure, but no ways extenuating licence,)
 <p>That even those yearnings after beauty, in wayward wanton youth,</p>
 <p>When, guileless of ulterior end, it craveth but to look upon the lovely,</p>
 <p>Seem like struggles of the soul, dimly remembering pre-existence,</p>
 <p>And feeling in its blindness for a long-lost god, to satisfy its longing;</p>
 <p>As if the sucking babe, tenderly mindful of his mother,</p>
 <p>Should pull a dragon's dugs, and drain the teats of poison.</p>
 <p>Our primal source was beauty, and we pant for it ever and again;</p>
 <p>But sin hath stopped the way with thorns; we turn aside, wander, and are lost.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">God,</span> the undiluted good, is root and stock of beauty,</p>
 <p>And every child of reason drew his essence from that stem.</p>
 <p>Therefore, it is of intuition, an innate hankering for home,</p>
 <p>A sweet returning to the well, from which our spirit flowed,</p>
 <p>That we, unconscious of a cause, should bask these darkened souls</p>
 <p>In some poor relics of the light that blazed in primal beauty,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">{248}</a></span>
 <p>And, even like as exiles of idolatry, should quaff from the cisterns of creation</p>
 <p>Stagnant draughts, for those fresh springs that rise in the Creator.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Only,</span> being burdened with the body, spiritual appetite is warped,</p>
 <p>And sensual man, with taste corrupted, drinketh of pollutions:</p>
 <p>Impulse is left, but indiscriminate; his hunger feasteth upon carrion;</p>
 <p>His natural love of beauty doateth over beauty in decay.</p>
 <p>He still thirsteth for the beautiful; but his delicate ideal hath grown gross,</p>
 <p>And the very sense of thirst hath been fevered from affection into passion.</p>
 <p>He remembereth the blessedness of light, but it is with an old man's memory,</p>
 <p>A blind old man from infancy, that once hath seen the sun,</p>
 <p>Whom long experience of night hath darkened in his cradle recollections,</p>
 <p>Until his brightest thought of noon is but a shade of black.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">This</span> then is thy charm, O beauty all pervading;</p>
 <p>And this thy wondrous strength, O beauty, conqueror of all:</p>
 <p>The outline of our shadowy best, the pure and comely creature,</p>
 <p>That winneth on the conscience with a saddening admiration:</p>
 <p>And some untutored thirst for God, the root of every pleasure,</p>
 <p>Native to creatures, yea in ruin, and dating from the birthday of the soul.</p>
 <p>For God sealeth up the sum, confirmed exemplar of proportions,</p>
 <p>Rich in love, full of wisdom, and perfect in the plenitude of Beauty.</p>

<div class="stanza">
 <p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Blow</span>
 the trumpet, spread the wing, fling thy scroll upon the sky,</p>
 <p>Rouse the slumbering world, O Fame, and fill the sphere with echo!</p>
 <p>&mdash;Beneath thy blast they wake, and murmurs come hoarsely on the wind,</p>
 <p>And flashing eyes and bristling hands proclaim they hear thy message:</p>
 <p>Rolling and surging as a sea, that upturned flood of faces</p>
 <p>Hasteneth with its million tongues to spread the wondrous tale;</p>
 <p>The hum of added voices groweth to the roaring of a cataract,</p>
 <p>And rapidly from wave to wave is tossed that exaggerated story,</p>
 <p>Until those stunning clamours, gradually diluted in the distance,</p>
 <p>Sink ashamed, and shrink afraid of noise, and die away.</p>
 <p>Then brooding Silence, forth from his hollow caverns,</p>
 <p>Cloaked and cowled, and gliding along, a cold and stealthy shadow,</p>
 <p>Once more is mingled with the multitude, whispering as he walketh,</p>
 <p>And hushing all their eager ears, to hear some newer Fame.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>
 <p>So all is still again; but nothing of the past hath been forgotten;</p>
 <p>A stirring recollection of the trumpet ringeth in the hearts of men:</p>
 <p>And each one, either envious or admiring, hath wished the chance were his</p>
 <p>To fill as thus the startled world with fame, or fear, or wonder.</p>
 <p>This lit thy torch of sacrilege, Ephesian Eratostratus;</p>
 <p>This dug thy living grave, Pythagoras, the traveller from Hadës;</p>
 <p>For this, dived Empedocles into Etna's fiery whirlpool;</p>
 <p>For this, conquerors, regicides, and rebels, have dared their perilous crimes.</p>
 <p>In all men, from the monarch to the menial, lurketh lust of fame:</p>
 <p>The savage and the sage alike regard their labours proudly:</p>
 <p>Yea, in death, the glazing eye is illumined by the hope of reputation,</p>
 <p>And the stricken warrior is glad, that his wounds are salved with glory.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">For</span> fame is a sweet self-homage, an offering grateful to the idol,</p>
 <p>A spiritual nectar for the spiritual thirst, a mental food for mind,</p>
 <p>A pregnant evidence to all of an after immaterial existence,</p>
 <p>A proof that soul is scatheless, when its dwelling is dissolved.</p>
 <p>And the manifold pleasures of fame are sought by the guilty and the good:</p>
 <p>Pleasures, various in kind, and spiced to every palate:</p>
 <p>The thoughtful loveth fame as an earnest of better immortality,</p>
 <p>The industrious and deserving, as a symbol of just appreciation,</p>
 <p>The selfish, as a promise of advancement, at least to a man's own kin,</p>
 <p>And common minds, as a flattering fact that men have been told of their existence.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a blameless love of fame, springing from desire of justice,</p>
 <p>When a man hath featly won and fairly claimed his honours:</p>
 <p>And then fame cometh as encouragement to the inward consciousness of merit,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span>
 <p>Gladdening by the kindliness and thanks, wherewithal his labours are rewarded.</p>
 <p>But there is a sordid imitation, a feverish thirst for notoriety,</p>
 <p>Waiting upon vanity and sloth, and utterly regardless of deserving:</p>
 <p>And then fame cometh as a curse; the fire-damp is gathered in the mine:</p>
 <p>The soul is swelled with poisonous air, and a spark of temptation shall explode it.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Idle</span> causes, noised awhile, shall yield most active consequents,</p>
 <p>And therefore it were ill upon occasion to scorn the voice of rumour.</p>
 <p>Ye have seen the chemist in his art mingle invisible gases;</p>
 <p>And lo, the product is a substance, a heavy dark precipitate:</p>
 <p>Even so fame, hurtling on the quiet with many meeting tongues,</p>
 <p>Can out of nothing bring forth fruits, and blossom on a nourishment of air.</p>
 <p>For many have earned honour, and thereby rank and riches,</p>
 <p>From false and fleeting tales, some casual mere mistake;</p>
 <p>And many have been wrecked upon disgrace, and have struggled with poverty and scorn,</p>
 <p>From envious hints and ill reports, the slanders cast on innocence.</p>
 <p>Whom may not scandal hit? those shafts are shot at a venture:</p>
 <p>Who standeth not in danger of suspicion? that net hath caught the noblest.</p>
 <p>Cæsar's wife was spotless, but a martyr to false fame;</p>
 <p>And Rumour, in temporary things, is gigantic as a ruin or a remedy:</p>
 <p>Many poor and many rich have testified its popular omnipotence,</p>
 <p>And many a panic-stricken army hath perished with the host of the Assyrians.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Nevertheless,</span> if opportunity be nought, let a man bide his time;</p>
 <p>So the matter be not merchandise nor conquest, fear thou less for character.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
 <p>Yea, rather give him license for awhile; it shall help thine honour afterward:</p>
 <p>Never yet was calumny engendered, but good men speedily discerned it,</p>
 <p>And innocence hath burst from its injustice, as the green world rolling out of Chaos.</p>
 <p>What, though still the wicked scoff,&mdash;this also turneth to his praise;</p>
 <p>Did ye never hear that censure of the bad is buttress to a good man's glory?</p>
 <p>What, if the ignorant still hold out, obstinate in unkind judgment,&mdash;</p>
 <p>Ignorance and calumny are paired; we affirm by two negations:</p>
 <p>Let them stand round about, pushing at the column in a circle,</p>
 <p>For all their toil and wasted strength, the foolish do but prop it.</p>
 <p>And note thou this; in the secret of their hearts, they feel the taunt is false,</p>
 <p>And cannot help but reverence the courage, that walketh amid calumnies unanswering:</p>
 <p>He standeth as a gallant chief, unheeding shot or shell;</p>
 <p>He trusteth in God his Judge: neither arrows nor the pestilence shall harm him.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">A high</span> heart is a sacrifice to Heaven: should it stoop among the creepers in the dust,</p>
 <p>To tell them that what God approved, is worthy of their praise?</p>
 <p>Never shall it heed the thought; but flaming on in triumph to the skies,</p>
 <p>And quite forgetting fame, shall find it added as a trophy.</p>
 <p>A great mind is an altar on a hill: should the priest descend from his altitude,</p>
 <p>To canvass offerings and worship from dwellers on the plain?</p>
 <p>Rather, with majestic perseverance will he minister in solitary grandeur,</p>
 <p>Confident the time will come, when pilgrims shall be flocking to the shrine.</p>
 <p>For fame is the birthright of genius; and he recketh not how long it be delayed;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
 <p>The heir need not hasten to his heritage, when he knoweth that his tenure is eternal.</p>
 <p>The careless poet of Avon, was he troubled for his fame,</p>
 <p>Or the deep-mouthed chronicler of Paradise, heeded he the suffrage of his equals?</p>
 <p>Mæonides took no thought, committing all his honours to the future,</p>
 <p>And Flaccus, standing on his watch-tower, spied the praise of ages.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Smoking</span> flax will breed a flame, and the flame may illuminate a world;</p>
 <p>Where is he who scorned that smoke as foul and murky vapour?</p>
 <p>The village stream swelled to a river, and the river was a kingdom's wealth,</p>
 <p>Where is he who boasted he could step across that stream?</p>
 <p>Such are the beginnings of the famous: little in the judgment of their peers,</p>
 <p>The juster verdict of posterity shall fix them in the orbits of the Great.</p>
 <p>Therefore dull Zoilus, clamouring ascendant of the hour,</p>
 <p>Will soon be fain to hide his hate, and bury up his bitterness for shame:</p>
 <p>Therefore mocking Momus, offended at the footsteps of Beauty,</p>
 <p>Shall win the prize of his presumption, and be hooted from his throne among the stars.</p>
 <p>For, as the shadow of a mountain lengtheneth before the setting sun,</p>
 <p>Until that screening Alp have darkened all the canton,&mdash;</p>
 <p>So, Fame groweth to its great ones; their images loom longer in departing;</p>
 <p>But the shadow of mind is light, and earth is filled with its glory.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">And</span> thou, student of the truth, commended to the praise of God,</p>
 <p>Wouldst thou find applause with men?&mdash;seek it not, nor shun it.</p>
 <p>Ancient fame is roofed in cedar, and her walls are marble;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
 <p>Modern fame lodgeth in a hut, a slight and temporary dwelling:</p>
 <p>Lay not up the treasures of thy soul within so damp a chamber,</p>
 <p>For the moth of detraction shall fret thy robe, and drop its eggs upon thy motive;</p>
 <p>Or the rust of disheartening reserve shall spoil the lustre of thy gold,</p>
 <p>Until its burnished beauty shall be dim as tarnished brass;</p>
 <p>Or thieves, breaking through to steal, shall claim thy jewelled thoughts,</p>
 <p>And turn to charge the theft on thee, a pilferer from them!</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a magnanimity in recklessness of fame, so fame be well deserving,</p>
 <p>That rusheth on in fearless might, the conscious sense of merit:</p>
 <p>And there is a littleness in jealousy of fame, looking as aware of weakness,</p>
 <p>That creepeth cautiously along, afraid that its title will be challenged.</p>
 <p>The wild boar, full of beechmast, flingeth him down among the brambles;</p>
 <p>Secure in bristly strength, without a watch, he sleepeth:</p>
 <p>But the hare, afraid to feed, croucheth in its own soft form;</p>
 <p>Wakefully with timid eyes, and quivering ears, he listeneth.</p>
 <p>Even so, a giant's might is bound up in the soul of Genius,</p>
 <p>His neck is strong with confidence, and he goeth tusked with power:</p>
 <p>Sturdily he roameth in the forest, or sunneth him in fen and field,</p>
 <p>And scareth from his marshy lair a host of fearful foes.</p>
 <p>But there is a mimic Talent, whose safety lieth in its quickness,</p>
 <p>A timorous thing of doubling guile, that scarce can face a friend:</p>
 <p>This one is captious of reproof, provident to snatch occasion,</p>
 <p>Greedy of applause, and vexed to lose one tittle of the glory.</p>
 <p>He is a poor warder of his fame, who is ever on the watch to keep it spotless;</p>
 <p>Such care argueth debility, a garrison relying on its sentinel.</p>
 <p>Passive strength shall scorn excuses, patiently waiting a re-action,</p>
 <p>He wotteth well that truth is great, and must prevail at last;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">{256}</a></span>
 <p>But fretful weakness hasteth to explain, anxiously dreading prejudice,</p>
 <p>And ignorant that perishable falsehood dieth as a branch cut off.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Purity</span> of motive and nobility of mind shall rarely condescend</p>
 <p>To prove its rights, and prate of wrongs, or evidence its worth to others.</p>
 <p>And it shall be small care to the high and happy conscience</p>
 <p>What jealous friends, or envious foes, or common fools may judge.</p>
 <p>Should the lion turn and rend every snarling jackal,</p>
 <p>Or an eagle be stopt in his career to punish the petulance of sparrows?</p>
 <p>Should the palm-tree bend his crown to chide the briar at his feet,</p>
 <p>Nor kindly help its climbing, if it hope, and be ambitious?</p>
 <p>Should the nightingale account it worth her pains to vindicate her music,</p>
 <p>Before some sorry finches, that affect to judge of song?</p>
 <p>No: many an injustice, many a sneer, and slur,</p>
 <p>Is passed aside with noble scorn by lovers of true fame:</p>
 <p>For well they wot that glory shall be tinctured good or evil,</p>
 <p>By the character of those who give it, as wine is flavoured by the wineskin:</p>
 <p>So that worthy fame floweth only from a worthy fountain,</p>
 <p>But from an ill-conditioned troop the best report is worthless.</p>
 <p>And if the sensibility of genius count his injuries in secret,</p>
 <p>Wisely will he hide the pains a hardened herd would mock:</p>
 <p>For the great mind well may be sad to note such littleness in brethren,</p>
 <p>The while he is comforted and happy in the firmest assurance of desert.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Cease</span> awhile, gentle scholar;&mdash;seek other thoughts and themes;</p>
 <p>Or dazzling Fame with wildfire light shall lure us on for ever.</p>
 <p>For look, all subjects of the mind may range beneath its banner,</p>

 <p>The mine is deep, and branching wide,&mdash;and who can work it out?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">{257}</a></span>
 <p>Years of thought would leave untold the boundless topic, Fame.</p>
 <p>Every matter in the universe is linked in suchwise unto others,</p>
 <p>That a deep full treatise upon one thing might reach to the history of all things:</p>
 <p>And before some single thesis had been followed out in all its branches,</p>
 <p>The wandering thinker would be lost in the pathless forest of existence.</p>
 <p>What were the matter or the spirit, that hath no part in Fame?</p>
 <p>Where were the fact irrelevant, or the fancy out of place?</p>
 <p>For the handling of that mighty theme should stretch from past to future,</p>
 <p>Catching up the present on its way, as a traveller burdened with time.</p>
 <p>All manner of men, their deeds, hopes, fortunes, and ambitions,</p>
 <p>All manner of events and things, climate, circumstance, and custom,</p>
 <p>Wealth and war, fear and hope, contentment, jealousy, devotion,</p>
 <p>Skill and learning, truth, falsehood, knowledge of things gone and things to come,</p>
 <p>Pride and praise, honour and dishonour, warnings, ensamples, emulations,</p>
 <p>The excellent in virtues, and the reprobate in vice, with the cloud of indifferent spectators,&mdash;</p>
 <p>Wave on wave with flooding force throng the shoals of thought,</p>
 <p>Filling that immeasurable theme, the height and depth of Fame.</p>
 <p>With soul unsatisfied and mind dismayed, my feet have touched the threshold,</p>
 <p>Fain to pour these flowers and fruits an offering on that altar:</p>
 <p>Lo, how vast the temple,&mdash;there are clouds within the dome!</p>
 <p>Yet might the huge expanse be filled, with volumes writ on Fame.</p>

 is commended of the deaf:&mdash;but is that praise despised?</p>
 <p>I trow not: with flattered soul the musician heard him gladly.</p>
 <p>Beauty is commended of the blind:&mdash;but is that compliment misliking?</p>
 <p>I trow not: though false and insincere, woman listened greedily.</p>
 <p>Vacant Folly talketh high of Learning's deepest reason:</p>
 <p>Is she hated for her hollowness?&mdash;learning held her wiser for the nonce.</p>
 <p>The worldly and the sensual, to gain some end, did homage to religion:</p>
 <p>And the good man gave thanks as for a convert, where others saw the hypocrite.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Yet</span> none of these were cheated at the heart, nor steadily believed those flatteries;</p>
 <p>They feared the core was rotten, while they hoped the skin was sound:</p>
 <p>But the fruits have so sweet fragrance, and are verily so pleasant to the eyes,</p>
 <p>It were an ungracious disenchantment to find them apples of Sodom.</p>
 <p>So they laboured to think all honest, winking hard with both their eyes;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
 <p>And hushed up every whisper that could prove that praise absurd:</p>
 <p>They willingly regard not the infirmities that make such worship vain,</p>
 <p>And palliate to their own fond hearts the faults they will not see.</p>
 <p>For the idol rejoiceth in his incense, and loveth not to shame his suppliants,</p>
 <p>Should he seek to find them false, his honours die with theirs:</p>
 <p>An offering is welcome for its own sake, set aside the giver,</p>
 <p>And praise is precious to a man, though uttered by the parrot or the mocking-bird.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">The</span> world is full of fools; and sycophancy liveth on the foolish:</p>
 <p>So he groweth great and rich, that fawning supple parasite.</p>
 <p>Sometimes he boweth like a reed, cringing to the pompousness of pride,</p>
 <p>Sometimes he strutteth as a gallant, pampering the fickleness of vanity;</p>
 <p>I have known him listen with the humble, enacting silent marveller,</p>
 <p>To hear some purse-proud dunce expose his poverty of mind;</p>
 <p>I have heard him wrangle with the obstinate, vowing that he will not be convinced,</p>
 <p>When some weak youth hath wisely feared the chance of ill success:</p>
 <p>Now, he will barely be a winner,&mdash;to magnify thy triumphs afterward;</p>
 <p>Now, he will hardly be a loser,&mdash;but cannot cease to wonder at thy skill:</p>
 <p>He laudeth his own worth, that the leader may have glory in his follower;</p>
 <p>He meekly confesseth his unworthiness, that the leader may have glory in himself.</p>
 <p>Many wiles hath he, and many modes of catching,</p>
 <p>But every trap is selfishness, and every bait is praise.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Come,</span> I would forewarn thee and forearm thee; for keen are the weapons of his warfare;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">{260}</a></span>
 <p>His thoughts are full of guile, deceitfully combining contrarieties,</p>
 <p>And when he doeth battle in a man, he is leagued with traitorous Self-love.</p>
 <p>Strange things have I noted, and opposite to common fancy;</p>
 <p>We leave the open surface, and would plumb the secret depths.</p>
 <p>For he will magnify a lover, even to disparaging his mistress;</p>
 <p>So much wisdom, goodness, grace,&mdash;and all to be enslaved?</p>
 <p>Till the Narcissus, self-enamoured, whelmed in floods of flattery,</p>
 <p>Is cheated from the constancy and fervency of love by friendship's subtle praise.</p>
 <p>Moreover, he will glorify a parent, even to the censure of his child,&mdash;</p>
 <p>O degenerate scion, of a stock so excellent and noble!</p>
 <p>Scant will he be in well-earned praise of a son before his father;</p>
 <p>And rarely commendeth to a mother her daughter's budding beauty:</p>
 <p>Yet shall he extol the daughter to her father, and be warm about the son before his mother;</p>
 <p>Knowing that self-love entereth not, to resist applause with jealousies.</p>
 <p>Wisely is he sparing of hyperbole where vehemence of praise would humble,</p>
 <p>For many a father liketh ill to be counted second to his son:</p>
 <p>And shrewdly the flatterer hath reckoned on a self still lurking in the mother,</p>
 <p>When his tongue was slow to speak of graces in the daughter.</p>
 <p>But if he descend a generation, to the grandsire his talk is of the grandson,</p>
 <p>Because in such high praise he hideth the honours of the son;</p>
 <p>And the daughter of a daughter may well exceed, in beauty, love, and learning,</p>
 <p>For unconsciously old age perceived&mdash;she cannot be my rival.</p>
 <p>These are of the deep things of flattery: and many a shallow sycophant</p>
 <p>Hath marvelled ill that praise of children seldom won their parents.</p>
 <p>This therefore note, unto detection: flattery can sneer as well as smile;</p>
 <p>And a master in the craft wotteth well, that his oblique thrust is surest.</p>

 <p>A vital, natural, subtle seed, everywhere hardy and indigenous.</p>
 <p>Go to the storehouse of thy memory, and take what is readiest to thy hand,&mdash;</p>
 <p>The noble deed, the clever phrase, for which thy pride was flattered:</p>
 <p>Oh, it hath been dwelt upon in solitude, and comforted thy heart in crowds,</p>
 <p>It hath made thee walk as in a dream, and lifted up the head above thy fellows;</p>
 <p>It hath compensated months of gloom, that minute of sweet sunshine,</p>
 <p>Drying up the pools of apathy, and kindling the fire of ambition:</p>
 <p>Yea, the flavour of that spice, mingled in the cup of life,</p>
 <p>Shall linger even to the dregs, and still be tasted with a welcome;</p>
 <p>The dame shall tell her grandchild of her coy and courted youth,</p>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Oftimes</span> to the sluggard and the dull, flattery hath done good service,</p>
 <p>Quickening the mind to emulation, and encouraging the heart that failed.</p>
 <p>Even so, a stimulating poison, wisely tendered by the leech,</p>

 <p>For, as a timid swimmer ventureth afloat with bladders,</p>
 <p>Until self-confidence and growth of skill have made him spurn their aid,</p>
 <p>Thus commendation may be prudent, where a child hath ill deserved it;</p>
 <p>But praise unmerited is flattery, and the cure will bring its cares:</p>
 <p>For thy son may find thee out, and thou shalt rue the remedy:</p>
 <p>Yea, rather, where thou canst not praise, be honest in rebuke.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">I have</span> seen the objects of a flatterer mirrored clearly on the surface,</p>

 <p>This is a commodity of merchandize, words put out at interest:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">{262}</a></span>
 <p>A scheme for canvassing opinions, and tinging them all with partiality.</p>
 <p>He is but a harmless fool; humour him with pitiful good-nature:</p>
 <p>If a poetaster quote thy song, be thou tender to his poem:</p>
 <p>Did the painter praise thy sketch? be kind, commend his picture;</p>
 <p>He looketh for a like return; then thank him with thy praise.</p>
 <p>In these small things with these small minds count thou the sycophant a courtier,</p>
 <p>And pay back, as blindly as ye may, the too transparent honour.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Also,</span> where the flattery is delicate, coming unobtrusive and in season,</p>
 <p>Though thou be suspicious of its truth, be generous at least to its gentility.</p>
 <p>The skilful thief of Lacedæmon had praise before his judges,</p>
 <p>And many caitiffs win applause for genius in their callings.</p>
 <p>Moreover, his meaning may be kind,&mdash;and thou art a debtor to his tongue;</p>
 <p>Hasten well to pay the debt, with charity and shrewdness:</p>
 <p>He must not think thee caught, nor feel himself discovered,</p>
 <p>Nor find thine answering compliment as hollow as his own.</p>
 <p>Though he be a smiling enemy, let him heed thee as the fearless and the friendly;</p>
 <p>A searching look, a poignant word, may prove thou art aware:</p>
 <p>Still, with compassion to the frail, though keen to see his soul,</p>
 <p>Let him not fear for thy discretion: see thou keep his secret, and thine own.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">However,</span> where the flattery is gross, a falsehood clear and fulsome,</p>
 <p>Crush the venomous toad, and spare not for a jewel in its head.</p>
 <p>Tell the presumptuous in flattery, that or ever he bespatter thee with praise,</p>
 <p>It might be well to stop and ask how little it were worth:</p>
 <p>Thou hast not solicited his suffrage,&mdash;let him not force thee to refuse it;</p>

 <p>Self-knowledge goeth armed, girt with many weapons,</p>
 <p>But carrieth whips for flattery, to lash it like a slave:</p>

 <p>To gorge both bait and hook, unheeding all but appetite:</p>
 <p>He smelleth praise and swalloweth,&mdash;yea, though it be palpable and plain,</p>

 <p>And though while fresh thy fragrance seemed even as the dews of charity,</p>
 <p>Yet afterward it fouled thy censer, as with savour of stale smoke.</p>
 <p>For the great mind detected thee at once, answering thine emptiness with pity,</p>
 <p>He saw thy self-interested zeal, and was not cozened by vain-glory:</p>
 <p>And the little mind is bloated with the praise, scorning him who gave it,</p>
 <p>A fool shall turn to be thy tyrant, an thou hast dubbed him great:</p>
 <p>And the medium mind of common men, loving first thy music,</p>
 <p>After, when the harmonies are done, shall feel small comfort in their echoes;</p>
 <p>For either he shall know thee false, conscious of contrary deservings,</p>
 <p>And, hating thee for falsehood, soon will scorn himself for truth,</p>
 <p>Or, if in aught to toilsome merit honest praise be due,</p>
 <p>Though for a season, belike, his weakness hath been raptured at thy witching,</p>

 <p>That thine exaggerated tongue hath robbed him of fair fame?</p>
 <p>Thou hast paid in forger's coins, and he had earned true money:</p>

 <p>Her face is a mask of fascination, but there hideth deformity behind;</p>

 <p>Thus will she glorify her skill, that it deftly caught thy kindness,</p>

 <p>He that hath salved thee with his tongue, shall now gnash upon thee with his teeth;</p>

 <p><span class="smcap">At</span> the last; have charity, young scholar,&mdash;yea, to the sycophant convicted;</p>

 <p>Mildly put aside, without rudeness of repulse, the pampering hand of flattery,</p>

<h3>OF NEGLECT.</h3>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="upper-case">Generous</span> and righteous is thy grief, slighted child of sensibility;</p>
 <p>For kindliness enkindleth love, but the waters of indifference quench it:</p>
 <p>Thy soul is athirst for sympathy, and hungereth to find affection,</p>
 <p>The tender scions of thy heart yearn for the sunshine of good feeling;</p>
 <p>And it is an evil thing and bitter, when the cheerful face of Charity,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span>
 <p>Going forth gaily in the morning to woo the world with smiles,</p>
 <p>Is met by those wayfaring men with coldness, suspicion, and repulse,</p>
 <p>And turneth into hard dead stone at the Gorgon visage of Neglect.</p>
 <p>O brother, warm and young, covetous of other's favour,</p>
 <p>I see thee checked and chilled, sorrowing for censure or forgetfulness:</p>
 <p>Let coarse and common minds despise&mdash;that wounding of thy vanity,</p>
 <p>Alas, I note a sorer cause, the blighting of thy love;</p>
 <p>Let the callous sensual deride thee,&mdash;disappointed of thy praise,</p>
 <p>Alas, thou hast a juster grief, defrauded of their kindness:</p>
 <p>It is a theme for tears to feel the soft heart hardening,</p>
 <p>The frozen breath of apathy sealing up the fountain of affection;</p>
 <p>It is a pang, keen only to the best, to be injured well-deserving,</p>
 <p>And slumbering Neglect is injury,&mdash;Could ye not watch one hour?</p>
 <p>When God Himself complained, it was that none regarded,</p>
 <p>And indifference bowed to the rebuke, Thou gavest Me no kiss when I came in.</p>

 <p><span class="smcap">Moreover,</span> praise is good; honour is a treasure to be hoarded;</p>
 <p>A good man's praise foreshadoweth God's, and in His smile is heaven:</p>
 <p>But men walk on in hardihood, steeling their sinfulness to censure,</p>
 <p>And when rebuke is ridiculed, the love of praise were an infirmity;</p>
 <p>The judge thou heedest not in fear, cannot have deep homage of thy hope,</p>
 <p>And who then is the wise of this world, that will own he trembleth at his fellows?</p>
 <p>Calm, careless, and insensible, he mocketh blame or calumny,</p>
 <p>Neither should his dignity be humbled to some pittance of their praise:</p>

 <p>Which evermore in secret strength unconquered Nature prizeth;</p>

 <p>For the sting of neglect is in this,&mdash;that such as we are all, forget us,</p>

 <p>Sympathy is lacking from the guilty such as we, even where angels minister,</p>

 <p>And it is a holy thirst to long for love's requital:</p>
 <p>Hard it will be, hard and sad, to love and be unloved;</p>
 <p>And many a thorn is thrust into the side of him that is forgotten.</p>
 <p>The oppressive silence of reserve, the frost of failing friendship,</p>
 <p>Affection blighted by repulse, or chilled by shallow courtesy,</p>
 <p>The unaided struggle, the unconsidered grief, the unesteemed self-sacrifice,</p>
 <p>The gift, dear evidence of kindness, long due, but never offered,</p>

 <p>It is mercy in the Merciful, and justice in the Just, to be jealous of His creature's love,</p>
 <p>But how should evil or duplicity arrogate affection to itself?</p>
 <p>Where love is happiness and duty, to be jealous of that love is godlike,</p>
 <p>But who can reverence the guilty? who findeth pleasure in the mean?</p>
 <p>Check the presumption of thy hopes: thankfully take refuge in obscurity,</p>
 <p>Or, if thou claimest merit, thy sin shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Yet</span> again: consider them of old, the good, the great, the learned,</p>
 <p>Who have blessed the world by wisdom, and glorified their God by purity.</p>
 <p>Did those speed in favour? were they the loved and the admired?</p>
 <p>Was every prophet had in honour? and every deserving one remembered to his praise?</p>
 <p>What shall I say of yonder band, a glorious cloud of witnesses,</p>
 <p>The scorned, defamed, insulted,&mdash;but the excellent of earth?</p>
 <p>It were weariness to count up noble names, neglected in their lives,</p>
 <p>Whom none esteemed, nor cared to love, till death had sealed them his.</p>
 <p>For good men are the health of the world, valued only when it perisheth,</p>
 <p>Like water, light, and air, all precious in their absence.</p>
 <p>Who hath considered the blessing of his breath, till the poison of an asthma struck him?</p>
 <p>Who hath regarded the just pulses of his heart, till spasm or paralysis have stopped them?</p>
 <p>Even thus, an unobserved routine of daily grace and wisdom,</p>
 <p>When no more here, had worship of a world, whose penitence atoned for its neglect.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">{273}</a></span>
 <p>And living genius is seen among infirmities, wherefrom the commoner are free;</p>
 <p>And other rival men of mind crowd this arena of contention;</p>
 <p>And there be many cares; and a man knoweth little of his brother;</p>
 <p>Feebly we appreciate a motive, and slowly keep pace with a feeling:</p>
 <p>And social difference is much; and experience teacheth sadly,</p>
 <p>How great the treachery of friends, how dangerous the courtesy of enemies.</p>
 <p>So, the sum of all these things operateth largely upon all men,</p>
 <p>Hedging us about with thorns, to cramp our yearning sympathies,</p>
 <p>And we grow materialized in mind, forgetting what we see not,</p>
 <p>But, immersed in perceptions of the present, keep things absent out of thought:</p>
 <p>Thus, where ingratitude, and guilt, and labour, and selfishness would harden,</p>
 <p>Humbly will the good man bow, unmurmuring, to Neglect.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Yet</span> once more, griever at Neglect, hear me to thy comfort, or rebuke:</p>
 <p>For, after all thy just complaint, the world is full of love.</p>
 <p>O heart of childhood, tender, trusting, and affectionate,</p>
 <p>O youth, warm youth, full of generous attentions,</p>
 <p>O woman, self-forgetting woman, poetry of human life,</p>
 <p>And not less thou, O man, so often the disinterested brother,</p>
 <p>Many a smile of love, many a tear of pity,</p>
 <p>Many a word of comfort, many a deed of magnanimity,</p>
 <p>Many a stream of milk and honey pour ye freely on the earth,</p>
 <p>And many a rosebud of love rejoiceth in the dew of your affection.</p>
 <p>Neglect? O liberal world, for thine are many prizes:</p>
 <p>Neglect? O charitable world, where thousands feed on bounty;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span>
 <p>Neglect? O just world, for thy judgments err not often;</p>
 <p>Neglect? O libel on a world where half that world is woman!</p>
 <p>Where is the afflicted, whose voice, once heard, stirreth not a host of comforters?</p>
 <p>Where is the sick untended, or in prison, and they visited him not?</p>
 <p>The hungry is fed, and the thirsty satisfied, till ability set limits to the will,</p>
 <p>And those who did it unto them, have done it unto God!</p>
 <p>For human benevolence is large, though many matters dwarf it,</p>
 <p>Prudence, ignorance, imposture, and the straitenings of circumstance and time.</p>
 <p>And if to the body, so to the mind, the mass of men are generous;</p>
 <p>Their estimate, who know us best, is seldom seen to err;</p>
 <p>Be sure the fault is thine, as pride, or shallowness, or vanity,</p>
 <p>If all around thee, good and bad, neglect thy seeming merit:</p>
 <p>No man yet deserved, who found not some to love him;</p>
 <p>And he, that never kept a friend, need only blame himself:</p>
 <p>Many for unworthiness will droop and die, but all are not unworthy;</p>
 <p>It must indeed be cold clay soil, that killeth every seed.</p>
 <p>Therefore, examine thy state, O self-accounted martyr of Neglect,</p>
 <p>It may be, thy merit is a cubit, and thy measure thereof a furlong;</p>
 <p>But grant it greater than thy thoughts, and grant that men thy fellows,</p>
 <p>For pleasure, business, or interest, misuse, forget, neglect thee,&mdash;</p>
 <p>Still be thou conqueror in this, the consciousness of high deservings;</p>
 <p>Let it suffice thee to be worthy; faint not thou for praise;</p>
 <p>For that thou art, be grateful; go humbly even in thy confidence;</p>
 <p>And set thy foot upon the neck of an enemy so harmless as Neglect.</p>

<h3>OF CONTENTMENT.</h3>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="upper-case">Godliness</span> with Contentment,&mdash;these be the pillars of felicity,</p>
 <p>Jachin, wherewithal it is established, and Boaz, in the which is strength;</p>
 <p>And upon their capitals is lily-work, the lotus fruit and flower,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">{276}</a></span>
 <p>Those fair and fragrant types of holiness, innocence, and beauty;</p>
 <p>Great gain pertaineth to the pillars, nets and chains of wreathen gold,</p>
 <p>And they stand up straight in the temple porch, the house where Glory dwelleth.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">The</span> body craveth meats, and the spirit is athirst for peacefulness,</p>
 <p>He that hath these, hath enough; for all beyond is vanity.</p>
 <p>Surfeit vaulteth over pleasure, to light upon the hither side of pain;</p>
 <p>And great store is great care, the rather if it mightily increaseth.</p>
 <p>Albeit too little is a trouble, yet too much shall swell into an evil,</p>
 <p>If wisdom stand not nigh to moderate the wishes:</p>
 <p>For covetousness never had enough, but moaneth at its wants for ever,</p>
 <p>And rich men have commonly more need to be taught contentment than the poor.</p>
 <p>That hungry chasm in their market-place gapeth still unsatisfied,</p>
 <p>Yea, fling in all the wealth of Rome,&mdash;it asketh higher victims;</p>
 <p>So, when the miser's gold cannot fill the measure of his lust,</p>
 <p>Curtius must leap into the pit, and avarice shall close upon his life.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Behold</span> Independence in his rags, all too easily contented,</p>
 <p>Careful for nothing, thankful for much, and uncomplaining in his poverty:</p>
 <p>Such an one have I somewhile seen earn his crust with gladness;</p>
 <p>He is a gatherer of simples, culling wild herbs upon the hills;</p>
 <p>And now, as he sitteth on the beach, with his motherless child beside him,</p>
 <p>To rest them in the cheerful sun, and sort their mints and horehound,&mdash;</p>
 <p>Tell me, can ye find upon his forehead the cloud of covetous anxiety,</p>
 <p>Or note the dull unkindled eyes of sated sons of pleasure?&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">{277}</a></span>
 <p>For there is more joy of life with that poor picker of the ditches,</p>
 <p>Than among the multitude of wealthy who wed their gains to discontent.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">I have</span> seen many rich, burdened with the fear of poverty,</p>
 <p>I have seen many poor, buoyed with all the carelessness of wealth:</p>
 <p>For the rich had the spirit of a pauper, and the moneyless a liberal heart;</p>
 <p>The first enjoyeth not for having, and the latter hath nothing but enjoyment.</p>
 <p>None is poor but the mean in mind, the timorous, the weak, and unbelieving;</p>
 <p>None is wealthy but the affluent in soul, who is satisfied and floweth over.</p>
 <p>The poor-rich is attenuate for fears, the rich-poor is fattened upon hopes;</p>
 <p>Cheerfulness is one man's welcome, and the other warneth from him by his gloom.</p>
 <p>Many poor have the pleasures of the rich, even in their own possessions;</p>
 <p>And many rich miss the poor man's comforts, and yet feel all his cares.</p>
 <p>Liberty is affluence, and the Helots of anxiety never can be counted wealthy;</p>
 <p>But he that is disenthralled from fear, goeth for the time a king;</p>
 <p>He is royal, great, and opulent, living free of fortune,</p>
 <p>And looking on the world as owner of its good, the Maker's child and heir:</p>
 <p>Whereas, the covetous is slavish, a very Midas in his avarice,</p>
 <p>Full of dismal dreams, and starved amongst his treasures:</p>
 <p>The ceaseless spur of discontent goaded him with instant apprehension,</p>
 <p>And his thirst for gold could never be quenched, for he drank with the throat of Crassus.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">{278}</a></span>
 <p><span class="smcap">Vanity,</span> and dreary disappointment, care, and weariness, and envy;</p>
 <p>Vanity is graven upon all things; wisely spake the preacher.</p>
 <p>For ambition is a burning mountain, thrown up amid the turbid sea,</p>
 <p>A Stromboli in sullen pride above the hissing waves;</p>
 <p>And the statesman climbing there, forgetful of his patriot intentions,</p>
 <p>Shall hate the strife of each rough step, or ever he hath toiled midway:</p>
 <p>And every truant from his home, the happy home of duty,</p>
 <p>Shall live to loathe his eminence of cares, that seething smoke and lava.</p>
 <p>Contentment is the temperate repast, flowing with milk and honey:</p>
 <p>Ambition is the drunken orgy, fed by liquid flames:</p>
 <p>A black and bitter frown is stamped upon the forehead of Ambition,</p>
 <p>But fair Contentment's angel-face is rayed with winning smiles.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">There</span> was in Tyre a merchant, the favourite child of fortune,</p>
 <p>An opulent man with many ships, to trade in many climes;</p>
 <p>And he rose up early to his merchandize, after feverish dreaming,</p>
 <p>And lay down late to his hot unrest, overwhelmed with calculated cares.</p>
 <p>So, day by day, and month by month, and year by year, he gained;</p>
 <p>And grew grey, and waxed great: for money brought him all things.</p>
 <p>All things?&mdash;verily, not all; the kernel of the nut is lacking,&mdash;</p>
 <p>His mind was a stranger to content, and as for Peace, he knew her not:</p>
 <p>Luxuries palled upon his palate, and his eyes were satiate with purple;</p>
 <p>He could coin much gold, but buy no happiness with it.</p>
 <p>And on a day, a day of dread, in the heat of inordinate ambition,</p>
 <p>When he threw with a gambler's hand, to lose or to double his possessions,</p>
 <p>The chance hit him,&mdash;he had speculated ill,&mdash;and men began to whisper;&mdash;</p>
 <p>Those he trusted, failed; and their usuries had bribed him deeply;</p>
 <p>One ship foundered out at sea,&mdash;and another met the pirate,&mdash;</p>
 <p>And so, with broken fortunes, men discreetly shunned him.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">{279}</a></span>
 <p>He was a stricken stag, and went to hide away in solitude,</p>
 <p>And there in humility, he thought,&mdash;he resolved, and promptly acted:</p>
 <p>From the wreck of all his splendours, from the dregs of the goblet of affluence,</p>
 <p>He saved with management a morsel and a drop, for his daily cup and platter:</p>
 <p>And lo, that little was enough, and in enough was competence;</p>
 <p>His cares were gone,&mdash;he slept by night, and lived at peace by day;</p>
 <p>Cured of his guilty selfishness,&mdash;money's love, envy, competition,&mdash;</p>
 <p>He lived to be thankful in a cottage that he had lost a palace:</p>
 <p>For he found in his abasement what he vainly had sought in high estate,</p>
 <p>Both mind and body well at ease, though robed in the russet of the lowly.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Once</span> more; a certain priest, happy in his high vocation,</p>
 <p>With faith, and hope, and charity, well served his village altar;</p>
 <p>As men count riches, he was poor; but great were his treasures in heaven,</p>
 <p>And great his joys on earth, for God's sake doing good:</p>
 <p>He had few cares and many consolations, one of the welcome everywhere;</p>
 <p>The labourer accounted him his friend, and magnates did him honour at their table:</p>
 <p>With a large heart and little means he still made many grateful,</p>
 <p>And felt as the centre of a circle, of comfort, calmness, and content.</p>
 <p>But, on a weaker sabbath,&mdash;for he preached both well and wisely,&mdash;</p>
 <p>Some casual hearer loudly praised his great neglected talents:</p>
 <p>Why should he be buried in obscurity, and throw these pearls to swine?</p>
 <p>Could he not still be doing good,&mdash;the whilst he pushed his fortunes?</p>
 <p>Then came temptation, even on the spark of discontent;</p>
 <p>The neighbouring town had a pulpit to be filled; hotly did he canvass, and won it:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">{280}</a></span>
 <p>Now was he popular and courted, and listened to the spell of admiration,</p>
 <p>And toiled to please the taste, rather than to pierce the conscience.</p>
 <p>Greedily he sought, and seeking found, the patronizing notice of the great;</p>
 <p>He thirsted for emoluments and honours, and counted rich men happy:</p>
 <p>So he flattered, so he preached; and gold and fame flowed in;</p>
 <p>They flowed in,&mdash;he was reaping his reward, and felt himself a fool.</p>
 <p>Alas, what a shadow was he following,&mdash;how precious was the substance he had left!</p>
 <p>Man for God, gold for good, this was his miserable bargain.</p>
 <p>The village church, its humble flock, and humbler parish priest,</p>
 <p>Zeal, devotion, and approving Heaven,&mdash;his books, and simple life,</p>
 <p>His little farm and flower-beds,&mdash;his recreative rambles with a friend,</p>
 <p>And haply, at eventide, the leaping trouts, to help their humble fare,</p>
 <p>All these wretchedly exchanged for what the world called fortune,</p>
 <p>With the harrowing conscience of a state relapsed to vain ambitions.</p>
 <p>Then,&mdash;for God was gracious to his soul,&mdash;his better thoughts returned,</p>
 <p>And better aims with better thoughts, his holy walk of old.</p>
 <p>Sickened of style, and ostentation, and the dissipative fashions of society,</p>
 <p>He deserted from the ranks of Mammon, and renewed his allegiance to God:</p>
 <p>For he found that the praises of men, and all that gold can give,</p>
 <p>Are not worthy to be named, against godliness and calm contentment.</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">A child</span>
 was playing in a garden, a merry little child,</p>
 <p>Bounding with triumphant health, and full of happy fancies;</p>
 <p>His kite was floating in the sunshine,&mdash;but he tied the string to a twig</p>
 <p>And ran among the roses to catch a new-born butterfly;</p>
 <p>His horn-book lay upon a bank, but the pretty truant hid it,</p>
 <p>Buried up in gathered grass, and moss, and sweet wild-thyme;</p>
 <p>He launched a paper boat upon the fountain, then wayward turned aside,</p>
 <p>To twine some fragrant jessamines about the dripping marble:</p>
 <p>So, in various pastime shadowing the schemes of manhood,</p>
 <p>That curly-headed boy consumed the golden hours:</p>
 <p>And I blessed his glowing face, envying the merry little child,</p>
 <p>As he shouted with the ecstasy of being, clapping his hands for joyfulness:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">{282}</a></span>
 <p>For I said, Surely, O Life, thy name is happiness and hope,</p>
 <p>Thy days are bright, thy flowers are sweet, and pleasure the condition of thy gift.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">A youth</span> was walking in the moonlight, walking not alone,</p>
 <p>For a fair and gentle maid leant on his trembling arm:</p>
 <p>Their whispering was still of beauty, and the light of love was in their eyes,</p>
 <p>Their twin young hearts had not a thought unvowed to love and beauty;</p>
 <p>The stars and the sleeping world, and the guardian eye of God,</p>
 <p>The murmur of the distant waterfall, and nightingales warbling in the thicket,</p>
 <p>Sweet speech of years to come, and promises of fondest hope,</p>
 <p>And more, a present gladness in each other's trust,</p>
 <p>All these fed their souls with the hidden manna of affection,</p>
 <p>While their faces shone beatified in the radiance of reflected Eden:</p>
 <p>I gazed on that fond youth, and coveted his heart,</p>
 <p>Attuned to holiest symphonies, with music in its strings:</p>
 <p>For I said, Surely, O Life, thy name is love and beauty,</p>
 <p>Thy joys are full, thy looks most fair, thy feelings pure and sensitive.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">A man</span> sat beside his merchandize, a careworn altered man,</p>
 <p>His waking hope, his nightly fear, were money, and its losses:</p>
 <p>Rarely was the laugh upon his cheek, except in bitter scorn</p>
 <p>For his foolishness of heart, and the lie of its romance, counting Love a treasure.</p>
 <p>His talk is of stern Reality, chilling unimaginative facts,</p>
 <p>The dull material accidents of this sensual body;</p>
 <p>Lucreless honour were contemptible, impoverished affection but a pauper's riches,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">{283}</a></span>
 <p>Duty, struggling unrewarded, the bargain of a cheated fool:</p>
 <p>The market value of a fancy must be measured by the gain it bringeth,</p>
 <p>No man is fed or clothed by fame, or love, or duty:&mdash;</p>
 <p>So toiled he day by day, that cold and joyless man,</p>
 <p>I gazed upon his haggard face, and sorrowed for the change:</p>
 <p>For I said, Surely, O Life, thy name is care and weariness,</p>
 <p>Thy soil is parched, thy winds are fierce, and the suns above thee hardening.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">A withered</span> elder lay upon his bed, a desolate man and feeble:</p>
 <p>His thoughts were of the past, the early past, the bygone days of youth:</p>
 <p>Bitterly repented he the years stolen by the god of this world:</p>
 <p>Remembering the maiden of his love, and the heart-stricken wife of his selfishness.</p>
 <p>For the sunshiny morning of life came again to him a vivid truth,</p>
 <p>But the years of toil as a long dim dream, a cloudy blighted noon:</p>
 <p>He saw the nutting schoolboy, but forgat the speculative merchant;</p>
 <p>The callous calculating husband was shamed by the generous lover:</p>
 <p>He knew that the weeds of worldliness, and the smoky breath of Mammon</p>
 <p>Had choked and killed those tender shoots, his yearnings after honour and affection;</p>
 <p>So was he sick at heart, and my pity strove to cheer him,</p>
 <p>But a deep and dismal gulf lay between comfort and his soul.</p>
 <p>Then I said, Surely, O Life, thy name is vanity and sorrow,</p>
 <p>Thy storms at noon are many, and thine eventide is clouded by remorse.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Now,</span> when I thought upon these things, my heart was grieved within me:</p>

 "Wherefore then must happiness and love wither into care and vanity,&mdash;
 <p>Wherefore is the bud so beautiful, but flower and fruit so blighted?</p>
 <p>Hard is the lot of man; to be lured by the meteor of romance,</p>
 <p>Only to be snared, and to sink, in the turbid mudpool of reality."</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Suddenly,</span> a light,&mdash;and a rushing presence,&mdash;and a consciousness of Something near me,&mdash;</p>

 <p>Vague, and dimly visible, mine eye could not behold Him,</p>
 <p>As, calmly unimpassioned, He looked upon an erring creature;</p>
 <p>Unseen, my spirit apprehended Him; though He spake not, yet I heard:</p>
 <p>For a sympathetic communing with Him flashed upon my mind electric.</p>

 <p>And guardian spirits weep that selfishness and sorrow should destroy it.</p>
 <p>Thou hast seen the natural blessing marred into a curse by man;</p>
 <p>Come then, in favour will I show thee the proper excellence of life.</p>
 <p>Keep thou purity, and watch against suspicion,&mdash;love shall never perish;</p>
 <p>Guard thine innocency spotless, and the buoyancy of childhood shall remain.</p>
 <p>Sweet ideals feed the soul, thoughts of loveliness delight it,</p>
 <p>The chivalrous affection of uncalculating youth lacketh not honourable wisdom.</p>
 <p>Charge not folly on invisibles, that render thee happier and purer,</p>

 <p>He, pure in his experience, loveth in his son's first love:</p>
 <p>Lofty aspirations, deep affections, holy hopes are his delight;</p>
 <p>His abhorrence is to strip from Life its charitable garment of Idea.</p>
 <p>The cold and callous sneerer, who heedeth of the merely practical,</p>

 <p>Passionate thirst for gain never hath burnt within his bosom,</p>
 <p>The leaden chains of that dull lust have not bound him prisoner:</p>
 <p>The shrewd world laughed at him for honesty, the vain world mouthed at him for honour,</p>
 <p>The false world hated him for truth, the cold world despised him for affection:</p>
 <p>Still, he kept his treasure, the warm and noble heart,</p>
 <p>And in that happy wise old man survive the child and lover.</p>
 <p>For human Life is as Chian wine, flavoured unto him who drinketh it,</p>

 <p>For time hath been wasted on the senses, to the hourly diminishing of spirit:</p>

 <p>And this is death in life; to be sunk beneath the waters of the Actual,</p>
 <p>Without one feebly-struggling sense of an airier spiritual realm:</p>
 <p>Affection, fancy, feeling&mdash;dead; imagination, conscience, faith,</p>
 <p>All wilfully expunged, till they leave the man mere carcase.</p>
 <p>See thou livest, whiles thou art: for heart must live, and soul,</p>

 <p>A man will grow to an automaton, an appendage to the counter or the desk,</p>
 <p>If mind and spirit be not roused, to raise the plodding groveller:</p>
 <p>Then praise God for sabbaths, for books, and dreams, and pains,</p>

 <p>It beginneth as a little path, edged with the violet and primrose,</p>
 <p>A little path of lawny grass, and soft to tiny feet:</p>
 <p>Soon, spring thistles in the way, those early griefs of school,</p>
 <p>And fruit-trees ranged on either hand show holiday delights:</p>
 <p>Anon, the rose and the mimosa hint at sensitive affection,</p>
 <p>And vipers hide among the grass, and briars are woven in the hedges:</p>
 <p>Shortly, staked along in order, stand the tender saplings,</p>
 <p>While hollow hemlock and tall ferns fill the frequent interval:</p>
 <p>So advancing, quaintly mixed, majestic line the way</p>
 <p>Sturdy oaks, and vigorous elms, the beech and forest-pine:</p>
 <p>And here the road is rough with rocks, wide, and scant of herbage,</p>
 <p>The sun is hot in heaven, and the ground is cleft and parched:</p>
 <p>And many-times a hollow trunk, decayed, or lightning-scathed,</p>
 <p>Or in its deadly solitude, the melancholy upas:</p>
 <p>But soon, with closer ranks, are set the sentinel trees,</p>
 <p>And darker shadows hover amongst Autumn's mellow tints;</p>
 <p>Ever and anon, a holly,&mdash;junipers, and cypresses, and yews;</p>
 <p>The soil is damp; the air is chill; night cometh on apace:</p>
 <p>Speed to the portal, traveller,&mdash;lo, there is a moon,</p>
 <p>With smiling light to guide thee safely through the dreadful shade:</p>
 <p>Hark,&mdash;that hollow knock,&mdash;behold, the warder openeth,</p>
 <p>The gate is gaping, and for thee;&mdash;those are the jaws of Death!</p>

 <p>The creature is constructed individual, for trial of his reasonable will,</p>

<h3>OF IDEAS.</h3>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Mind</span>
 is like a volatile essence, flitting hither and thither,</p>
 <p>A solitary sentinel of the fortress body, to show himself everywhere by turns:</p>
 <p>Mind is indivisible and instant, with neither parts nor organs,</p>
 <p>That it doeth, it doth quickly, but the whole mind doth it:</p>
 <p>An active versatile agent, untiring in the principle of energy,</p>
 <p>Nor space, nor time, nor rest, nor toil, can affect the tenant of the brain;</p>
 <p>His dwelling may verily be shattered, and the furniture thereof be disarranged,</p>
 <p>But the particle of Deity in man slumbereth not, neither can be wearied:</p>
 <p>However swift to change, even as the field of a kaleidoscope,</p>
 <p>It taketh in but one idea at once, moulded for the moment to its likeness:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">{318}</a></span>
 <p>Mind is as the quicksilver, which, poured from vessel to vessel,</p>
 <p>Instantly seizeth on a shape, and as instantly again discardeth it;</p>
 <p>For it is an apprehensive power, closing on the properties of Matter,</p>
 <p>Expanding to enwrap a world, collapsing to prison up an atom:</p>
 <p>As, by night, thine irritable eyes may have seen strange changing figures,</p>
 <p>Now a wheel, now suddenly a point, a line, a curve, a zigzag,</p>
 <p>A maze ever altering, as the dance of gnats upon a sunbeam,</p>
 <p>Swift, intricate, neither to be prophesied, nor to be remembered in succession,</p>
 <p>So, the mind of a man, single, and perpetually moving,</p>
 <p>Flickereth about from thought to thought, changed with each idea;</p>
 <p>For the passing second metamorphosed to the image of that within its ken,</p>
 <p>And throwing its immediate perceptions into each cause of contemplation.</p>
 <p>It shall regard a tree; and unconsciously, in separate review,</p>
 <p>Embrace its colour, shape, and use, whole and individual conceptions;</p>
 <p>It shall read or hear of crime, and cast itself into the commission;</p>
 <p>It shall note a generous deed, and glow for a moment as the doer;</p>
 <p>It shall imagine pride or pleasure, treading on the edges of temptation;</p>
 <p>Or heed of God and of His Christ, and grow transformed to glory.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Therefore,</span> it is wise and well to guide the mind aright,</p>
 <p>That its aptness may be sensitive to good, and shrink with antipathy from evil:</p>
 <p>For use will mould and mark it, or nonusage dull and blunt it;&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">{319}</a></span>
 <p>So to talk of spirit by analogy with substance;</p>
 <p>And analogy is a truer guide, than many teachers tell of,</p>
 <p>Similitudes are scattered round, to help us, not to hurt us;</p>
 <p>Moses, in his every type, and the Greater than Moses, in His parables,</p>
 <p>Preach, in terms that all may learn, the philosophic lessons of analogy:</p>
 <p>And here, in a topic immaterial, the likeness of analogy is just;</p>
 <p>By habits, knit the nerves of mind, and train the gladiator shrewdly:</p>
 <p>For thought shall strengthen thinking, and imagery speed imagination,</p>
 <p>Until thy spiritual inmate shall have swelled to the giant of Otranto.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Nevertheless,</span> heed well, that this Athlete, growing in thy brain,</p>
 <p>Be a wholesome Genius, not a cursed Afrite:</p>
 <p>And see thou discipline his strength, and point his aim discreetly;</p>
 <p>Feed him on humility and holy things, weaned from covetous desires;</p>
 <p>Hour by hour and day by day, ply him with ideas of excellence,</p>
 <p>Dragging forth the evil but to loathe, as a Spartan's drunken Helot:</p>
 <p>And win, by gradual allurements, the still expanding soul,</p>
 <p>To rise from a contemplated universe, even to the Hand that made it.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">A common</span> mind perceiveth not beyond his eyes and ears:</p>
 <p>The palings of the park of sense enthral this captured roebuck:</p>
 <p>And still, though fettered in the flesh, he doth not feel his chains,</p>
 <p>Externals are the world to him, and circumstance his atmosphere.</p>
 <p>Therefore tangible pleasures are enough for the animal man;</p>
 <p>He is swift to speak and slow to think, dreading his own dim conscience;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">{320}</a></span>
 <p>And solitude is terrible, and exile worse than death,</p>
 <p>He cannot dwell apart, nor breathe at a distance from the crowd.</p>
 <p>But minds of nobler stamp, and chiefest the mint-marked of heaven,</p>
 <p>Walk independent, by themselves, freely manumitted of externals:</p>
 <p>They carry viands with them, and need no refreshment by the way,</p>
 <p>Nor drink of other wells than their own inner fountain.</p>
 <p>Strange shall it seem how little such a man will lean upon the accidents of life,</p>
 <p>He is winged and needeth not a staff; if it break, he shall not fall:</p>
 <p>And lightly perchance doth he remember the stale trivialities around him,</p>
 <p>He liveth in the realm of thought, beyond the world of things;</p>
 <p>These are but transient Matter, and himself enduring Spirit:</p>
 <p>And worldliness will laugh to scorn that sublimated wisdom.</p>
 <p>His eyes may open on a prison-cell, but the bare walls glow with imagery;</p>
 <p>His ears may be filled with execration, but are listening to the music of sweet thoughts;</p>
 <p>He may dwell in a hovel with a hero's heart, and canopy his penury with peace,</p>
 <p>For mind is a kingdom to the man, who gathereth his pleasure from Ideas.</p>

<h3>OF NAMES.</h3>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="upper-case">Adam</span> gave the name, when the Lord had made His creature,</p>
 <p>For God led them in review, to see what man would call them.</p>
 <p>As they struck his senses, he proclaimed their sounds,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">{322}</a></span>
 <p>A name for the distinguishing of each, a numeral by which it should be known:</p>
 <p>He specified the partridge by her cry, and the forest prowler by his roaring,</p>
 <p>The tree by its use, and the flower by its beauty, and everything according to its truth.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">There</span> is an arbitrary name; whereunto the idea attacheth;</p>
 <p>And there is a reasonable name, linking its fitness to idea:</p>
 <p>Yet shall these twain run in parallel courses,</p>
 <p>Neither shall thou readily discern the habit from the nature.</p>
 <p>For mind is apt and quick to wed ideas and names together,</p>
 <p>Nor stoppeth its perception to be curious of priorities;</p>
 <p>And there is but little in the sound, as some have vainly fancied,</p>
 <p>The same tone in different tongues shall be suitable to opposite ideas:</p>
 <p>Yea, take an ensample in thine own; consider similar words:</p>
 <p>How various and contrary the thoughts those kindred names produce:</p>
 <p>A house shall seem a fitting word to call a roomy dwelling,</p>
 <p>Yet there is a like propriety in the small smooth sound, a mouse:</p>
 <p>Mountain, as if of a necessity, is a word both mighty and majestic,&mdash;</p>
 <p>What heed ye then of Fountain?&mdash;flowing silver in the sun.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Many</span> a fair flower is burdened with preposterous appellatives,</p>
 <p>Which the wiser simplicity of rustics entitled by its beauties;</p>
 <p>And often the conceit of science, loving to be thought cosmopolite,</p>
 <p>Shall mingle names of every clime, alike obscure to each.</p>
 <p>There is wisdom in calling a thing fitly; name should note particulars</p>
 <p>Through a character obvious to all men, and worthy of their instant acceptation.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">{323}</a></span>
 <p>The herbalist had a simple cause for every word upon his catalogue,</p>
 <p>But now the mouth of Botany is filled with empty sound;</p>
 <p>And many a peasant hath an answer on his tongue, concerning some vexed flower,</p>
 <p>Shrewder than the centipede phrase, wherewithal philosophers invest it.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">For</span> that, the foolishness of pride, and flatteries of cringing homage,</p>
 <p>Strew with chaff the threshing-floors of science; names perplex them all:</p>
 <p>The entomologist, who hath pried upon an insect, straightway shall endow it with his name;</p>
 <p>It had many qualities and marks of note,&mdash;but in chief, a vain observer:</p>
 <p>The geographer shall journey to the pole, through biting frost and desolation,</p>
 <p>And, for some simple patron's sake, shall name that land, the happy:</p>
 <p>The fossilist hath found a bone, the rib of some huge lizard,</p>
 <p>And forthwith standeth to it sponsor, to tack himself on reptile immortalities:</p>
 <p>The sportsman, hunting at the Cape, found some strange-horned antelope,</p>
 <p>The spots are new, the fame is cheap, and so his name is added.</p>
 <p>Thus, obscurities encumber knowledge, even by the vanity of men</p>
 <p>Who play into each other's hand the game of giving names.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Various</span> are the names of men, and drawn from different wells;</p>
 <p>Aspects of body, or characters of mind, the creature's first idea:</p>
 <p>And some have sprung of trades, and some of dignities or office;</p>
 <p>Other some added to a father's, and yet more growing from a place:</p>
 <p>Animal creation, with sciences, and things,&mdash;their composites, and near associations,</p>
 <p>Contributed their symbollings of old, wherewith to title men:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">{324}</a></span>
 <p>And heraldry set upon its cresture the figured attributes as ensigns</p>
 <p>By which, as by a name concrete, its bearer should be known.</p>

<div class="stanza">

 <p>Horns of power, feathers of the swift, mitres of catholic dominion,</p>
 <p>The sovereign asp, the circle everlasting, the crook and thong of justice,</p>
 <p>By many mystic shapes and sounds displayed the idol's name.</p>
 <p>Thereafter, high-plumed warriors, the chieftains of Etruria and Troy,</p>
 <p>And Xerxes, urging on his millions to the tomb of pride, Thermopylæ,</p>
 <p>And Hiero with his bounding ships, all figured at the prow,</p>
 <p>And Rome's Prætorian standards, piled with strange devices,</p>
 <p>And stout crusaders pressing to the battle, clad in sable mail;</p>
 <p>These all in their speaking symbols, earned, or wore, a name.</p>
 <p>Eve; the mother of all living, and Abraham, father of a multitude,</p>
 <p>Jacob, the supplanter, and David, the beloved, and all the worthies of old time,</p>
 <p>Noah, who came for consolation, and Benoni, son of sorrow,</p>
 <p>Kings and prophets, children of the East, owned each his title of significance.</p>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">There</span> be names of high descent, and thereby storied honours;</p>
 <p>Names of fair renown, and therein characters of merit:</p>

 <p>Yea, many weeds run rank in pride, if men have dubbed them cedars.</p>
 <p>And to herald common mediocrity with the noisy notes of fame,</p>
 <p>Tendeth to its deeper scorn; as if it were to call the mole a mammoth.</p>
 <p>Yet shall ye find the trader's babe dignified with sounding titles,</p>
 <p>And little hath the father guessed the harm he did his child:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">{325}</a></span>
 <p>For either may they breed him discontent, a peevish repining at his station,</p>
 <p>Or point the finger of despite at the mule in the trappings of an elephant:</p>
 <p>And it is a kind of theft to filch appellations from the famous,</p>
 <p>A soiling of the shrines of praise with folly's vulgar herd.</p>
 <p>Prudence hath often gone ashamed for the name they added to his father's,</p>
 <p>If minds of mark and great achievements bore it well before;</p>
 <p>For he walketh as the jay in the fable, though not by his own folly,</p>
 <p>Another's fault hath compassed his misfortune, making him a martyr to his name.</p>

 <p>For it were a sore hindrance to hold it in common with a hundred:</p>
 <p>In the Babel of confused identities fame is little feasible,</p>
 <p>The felon shall detract from the philanthropist, and the sage share honours with the simple:</p>
 <p>Still, in thy title of distinguishment, fall not into arrogant assumption,</p>
 <p>Steering from caprice and affectations; and for all thou doest, have a reason.</p>
 <p>He that is ambitious for his son, should give him untried names,</p>
 <p>For those that have served other men, haply may injure by their evils;</p>
 <p>Or otherwise may hinder by their glories; therefore, set him by himself,</p>
 <p>To win for his individual name some clear specific praise.</p>
 <p>There were nine Homers, all goodly sons of song, but where is any record of the eight?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">{326}</a></span>
 <p>One grew to fame, an Aaron's rod, and swallowed up his brethren:</p>
 <p>Who knoweth? more distinctly titled, those dead eight had lived;</p>
 <p>But the censers were ranged in a circle to mingle their sweets without a difference.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Art</span> thou named of a common crowd, and sensible of high aspirings?</p>
 <p>It is hard for thee to rise,&mdash;yet strive: thou mayest be among them a Musæus.</p>
 <p>Art thou named of a family, the same in successive generations?</p>
 <p>It is open to thee still to earn for epithets, such an one, the good or great.</p>
 <p>Art thou named foolishly? Show that thou art wiser than thy fathers;</p>
 <p>Live to shame their vanity or sin by dutiful devotion to thy sphere.</p>
 <p>Art thou named discreetly? It is well, the course is free;</p>
 <p>No competitor shall claim thy colours, neither fix his faults upon thee:</p>
 <p>Hasten to the goal of fame between the posts of duty,</p>
 <p>And win a blessing from the world, that men may love thy name:</p>
 <p>Yea, that the unction of its praise, in fragrance well deserving,</p>
 <p>May float adown the stream of time, like ambergris at sea;</p>
 <p>So thy sons may tell their sons, and those may teach their children,</p>
 <p>He died in goodness, as he lived;&mdash;and left us his good name.</p>
 <p>And more than these: there is a roll whereon thy name is written;</p>
 <p>See that, in the Book of Doom, that name is fixed in light:</p>
 <p>Then, safe within a better home, where time and its titles are not found,</p>
 <p>God will give thee His new Name, and write it on thy heart:</p>
 <p>A Name better than of sons, a Name dearer than of daughters,</p>

<h3>OF THINGS.</h3>

<div class="image-left">

</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Taken</span>
 separately from all substance, and flying with the feathered flock of thoughts,</p>
 <p>The idea of a thing hath the nature of its Soul, a separate seeming essence:</p>
 <p>Intimately linked to the idea, suggesting many qualities,</p>
 <p>The name of a thing hath the nature of its Mind, an intellectual recorder:</p>
 <p>And the matter of a thing, concrete, is a Body to the perfect creature,</p>
 <p>Compacted three in one, as all things else within the universe.</p>
 <p>Nothing canst thou add to them, and nothing take away, for all have these proportions,</p>
 <p>The thought, the word, the form, combining in the Thing:</p>
 <p>All separate, yet harmonizing well, and mingled each with other,</p>
 <p>One whole in several parts, yet each part spreading to a whole:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">{328}</a></span>
 <p>The idea is a whole; and the meaning phrase that spake idea, a whole;</p>
 <p>And the matter, as ye see it, is a whole; the mystery of true triunity:</p>
 <p>Yea, there is even a deeper mystery,&mdash;which none, I wot, can fathom,</p>
 <p>Matter, different from properties whereby the solid substance is described;</p>
 <p>For, size and weight, cohesion and the like, live distinct from matter,</p>
 <p>Yet who can imagine matter, unendowed with size and weight?</p>
 <p>As in the spiritual, so in the material, man must rest with patience,</p>
 <p>And wait for other eyes wherewith to read the books of God.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Men</span> have talked learnedly of atoms, as if matter could be ever indivisible;</p>
 <p>They talk, but ill are skilled to teach, and darken truth by fancies:</p>
 <p>An atom by our grosser sense was never yet conceived,</p>
 <p>And nothing can be thought so small, as not to be divided:</p>
 <p>For an atom runneth to infinity, and never shall be caught in space,</p>
 <p>And a molecule is no more indivisible than Saturn's belted orb.</p>
 <p>Things intangible, multiplied by multitudes, never will amass to substance,</p>
 <p>Neither can a thing which may be touched, be made of impalpable proportions;</p>
 <p>The sum of indivisibles must needs be indivisible, as adding many nothings,</p>
 <p>And the building up of atoms into matter is but a silly sophism;</p>
 <p>Lucretius, and keen Anaximander, and many that have followed in their thoughts,</p>
 (For error hath a long black shadow, dimming light for ages,)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">{329}</a></span>

 <p>Things breed thoughts; therefore the Brahmin and the Burman</p>
 <p>With mythologic shapes adorn their coarse pantheon:</p>
 <p>Things breed thoughts; therefore the statue and the picture,</p>
 <p>Relics, rosaries, and miracles in act, quicken the Papist in his worship:</p>
 <p>Things breed thoughts; therefore the lovers at their parting,</p>
 <p>Interchanged with tearful smiles the dear reminding tokens:</p>
 <p>Things breed thoughts; therefore when the clansman met his foe,</p>
 <p>The bloodstained claymore in his hand revived the memories of vengeance.</p>

 <p><span class="smcap">Things</span> teach with double force; through the animal eye, and through the mind,</p>

 <p>Thence is the potency of travel, the precious might of its advantages</p>
 <p>To compensate its dissipative harm, its toil and cost and danger.</p>
 <p>Ulysses, wandering to many shores, lived in many cities,</p>
 <p>And thereby learnt the minds of men, and stored his own more richly:</p>
 <p>Herodotus, the accurate and kindly, spake of that he saw,</p>
 <p>And reaped his knowledge on the spot, in fertile fields of Egypt:</p>
 <p>Lycurgus culled from every clime the golden fruits of justice;</p>
 <p>And Plato roamed through foreign lands, to feed on truth in all.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">{330}</a></span>
 <p>For travel, conversant with Things, bringeth them in contact with the mind;</p>
 <p>We breathe the wholesome atmosphere about ungarbled truth:</p>
 <p>Pictures of fact are painted on the eye, to decorate the house of intellect,</p>
 <p>Rather than visions of fancy, filling all the chambers with a vapour.</p>
 <p>For, in Ideas, the great mind will exaggerate, and the lesser extenuate truth;</p>
 <p>But in Things the one is chastened, and the other quickened, to equality:</p>
 <p>And in Names,&mdash;though a property be told, rather than some arbitrary accident,</p>
 <p>Still shall the thought be vague or false, if none have seen the Thing:</p>
 <p>For in Things the property with accident standeth in a mass concrete,</p>
 <p>These cannot cheat the sense, nor elude the vigilance of spirit.</p>
 <p>Travel is a ceaseless fount of surface education,</p>
 <p>But its wisdom will be simply superficial, if thou add not thoughts to things:</p>
 <p>Yet, aided by the varnish of society, things may serve for thoughts,</p>
 <p>Till many dullards that have seen the world shall pass for scholars:</p>
 <p>Because one single glance will conquer all descriptions,</p>
 <p>Though graphic, these left some unsaid, though true, these tended to some error;</p>
 <p>And the most witless eye that saw, had a juster notion of its object,</p>
 <p>Than the shrewdest mind that heard and shaped its gathered thoughts of Things.</p>

 <p><span class="smcap">Confidence</span> is conqueror of men; victorious both over them and in them;</p>
 <p>The iron will of one stout heart shall make a thousand quail:</p>
 <p>A feeble dwarf, dauntlessly resolved, will turn the tide of battle,</p>
 <p>And rally to a nobler strife the giants that had fled;</p>
 <p>The tenderest child, unconscious of a fear, will shame the man to danger,</p>
 <p>And when he dared it, danger died, and faith had vanquished fear.</p>
 <p>Boldness is akin to power: yea, because ignorance is weakness,</p>
 <p>Knowledge with unshrinking might will nerve the vigorous hand:</p>
 <p>Boldness hath a startling strength; the mouse may fright a lion,</p>
 <p>And oftentimes the horned herd is scared by some brave cur.</p>
 <p>Courage hath analogy with faith, for it standeth both in animal and moral;</p>
 <p>The true is mindful of a God, the false is stout in self:</p>
 <p>But true or false, the twain are faith; and faith worketh wonders:</p>
 <p>Never was a marvel done upon the earth, but it had sprung of faith:</p>
 <p>Nothing noble, generous, or great, but faith was the root of the achievement;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">{333}</a></span>
 <p>Nothing comely, nothing famous, but its praise is faith.</p>
 <p>Leonidas fought in human faith, as Joshua in divine:</p>
 <p>Xenophon trusted to his skill, and the sons of Mattathias to their cause:</p>
 <p>In faith Columbus found a path across those untried waters;</p>
 <p>The heroines of Arc and Saragossa fought in earthly faith:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">{334}</a></span>
 <p>Tell was strong, and Alfred great, and Luther wise, by faith;</p>
 <p>Margaret by faith was valiant for her son, and Wallace mighty for his people:</p>
 <p>Faith in his reason made Socrates sublime, as faith in his science, Galileo:</p>
 <p>Ambassadors in faith are bold, and unreproved for boldness:</p>
 <p>Faith urged Fabius to delays, and sent forth Hannibal to Cannæ:</p>
 <p>Cæsar at the Rubicon, Miltiades at Marathon; both were sped by faith.</p>
 <p>I set not all in equal spheres: I number not the martyr with the patriot;</p>
 <p>I class not the hero with his horse, because the twain have courage;</p>
 <p>But only for ensample and instruction, that all things stand by faith;</p>
 <p>Albeit faith of divers kinds, and varying in degree.</p>
 <p>There is a faith towards men, and there is a faith towards God;</p>
 <p>The latter is the gold and the former is the brass; but both are sturdy metal:</p>
 <p>And the brass mingled with the gold floweth into rich Corinthian;</p>
 <p>A substance bright and hard and keen, to point Achilles' spear:</p>
 <p>So shall thou stop the way against the foes that hem thee;</p>
 <p>Trust in God to strengthen man;&mdash;be bold, for He doth help.</p>

 <p><span class="smcap">Yet</span> more: for confidence in man, even to the worst and meanest,</p>
 <p>Hath power to overcome his ill, by charitable good.</p>
 <p>Fling thine unreserving trust even on the conscience of a culprit,</p>
 <p>Soon wilt thou shame him by thy faith, and he will melt and mend:</p>
 <p>The nest of thieves will harm thee not, if thou dost bear thee boldly;</p>
 <p>Boldly, yea and kindly, as relying on their honour:</p>
 <p>For the hand so stout against aggression, is quite disarmed by charity;</p>
 <p>And that warm sun will thaw the heart case-hardened by long frost.</p>
 <p>Treat men gently, trust them strongly, if thou wish their weal;</p>
 <p>Or cautious doubt and bitter thoughts will tempt the best to foil thee.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">{335}</a></span>
 <p>Believe the well in sanguine hope, and thou shall reap the better;</p>
 <p>But if thou deal with men so ill, thy dealings make them worse;</p>
 <p>Despair not of some gleams of good still lingering in the darkest,</p>
 <p>And among veterans in crime, plead thou as with their children:</p>
 <p>So, astonied at humanities, the bad heart long estranged,</p>
 <p>Shall even weep to feel himself so little worth thy love;</p>
 <p>In wholesome sorrow will he bless thee; yea, and in that spirit may repent;</p>
 <p>Thus wilt thou gain a soul, in mercy given to thy Faith.</p>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Look</span> aside to lack of faith, the mass of ills it bringeth:</p>
 <p>All things treacherous, base, and vile, dissolving the brotherhood of men.</p>
 <p>Bonds break; the cement hath lost its hold; and each is separate from other;</p>
 <p>That which should be neighbourly and good, is cankered into bitterness and evil.</p>
 <p>O thou serpent, fell Suspicion, coiling coldly round the heart,&mdash;</p>
 <p>O thou asp of subtle Jealousy, stinging hotly to the soul,&mdash;</p>
 <p>O distrust, reserve, and doubt,&mdash;what reptile shapes are here,</p>
 <p>Poisoning the garden of a world with death among its flowers!</p>
 <p>No need of many words, the tale is easy to be told;</p>
 <p>A point will touch the truth, a line suggest the picture.</p>
 <p>For if, in thine own home, a cautious man and captious,</p>
 <p>Thou hintest at suspicion of a servant, thou soon wilt make a thief;</p>
 <p>Or if, too keen in care, thou dost evidently disbelieve thy child,</p>
 <p>Thou hast injured the texture of his honour, and smoothed to him the way of lying:</p>
 <p>Or if thou observest upon friends, as seeking thee selfishly for interest,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">{336}</a></span>
 <p>Thou hast hurt their kindliness to thee, and shalt be paid with scorn;</p>
 <p>Or if, O silly ones of marriage, your foul and foolish thoughts,</p>
 <p>Harshly misinterpreting in each the levity of innocence for sin,</p>
 <p>Shall pour upon the lap of home pain where once was pleasure,</p>
 <p>And mix contentions in the cup, that mantled once with comforts,</p>
 <p>Bitterly and justly shall ye rue the punishment due to unbelief;</p>
 <p>Ye trust not each the other, nor the mutual vows of God;</p>
 <p>Take heed, for the pit may now be near, a pit of your own digging,&mdash;</p>
 <p>Faith abused tempteth unto crime, and doubt may make its monster.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Man</span> verily is vile, but more in capability than action;</p>
 <p>His sinfulness is deep, but his transgressions may be few, even from the absence of temptation:</p>
 <p>He is hanging in a gulf midway, but the air is breathable about him:</p>
 <p>Thrust him not from that slight hold, to perish in the vapours underneath.</p>
 <p>For, God pleadeth with the deaf, as having ears to hear,</p>
 <p>Christ speaketh to the dead, as those that are capable of living;</p>
 <p>And an evil teacher is that man, a tempter to much sin,</p>
 <p>Who looketh on his hearers with distrust, and hath no confidence in brethren.</p>
 <p>All may mend; and sympathies are healing: and reason hath its influence with the worst;</p>
 <p>And in those worst is ample hope, if only thou hast charity, and faith.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Somewhiles</span> have I watched a man exchanging the sobriety of faith,</p>
 <p>Old lamps for new,&mdash;even for fanatical excitements.</p>
 <p>He gained surface, but lost solidity; heat, in lieu of health;</p>
 <p>And still with swelling words and thoughts he scorned his ancient coldness:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">{337}</a></span>
 <p>But, his strength was shorn as Samson's; he walked he knew not whither;</p>
 <p>Doubt was on his daily path; and duties shewed not certain:</p>
 <p>Until, in an hour of enthusiasm, stung with secret fears,</p>
 <p>He pinned the safety of his soul on some false prophet's sleeve.</p>
 <p>And then, that sure word failed; and with it, failed his faith;</p>
 <p>It failed, and fell; O deep and dreadful was his fall in faith!</p>
 <p>He could not stop, with reason's rein, his coursers on the slope,</p>
 <p>And so they dashed him down the cliff of hardened unbelief.</p>
 <p>With overreaching grasp he had strained for visionary treasures,</p>
 <p>But a fiend had cheated his presumption, and hurled him to despair.</p>
 <p>So he lay in his blood, the victim of a credulous false faith,</p>
 <p>And many nights, and night-like days, he dwelt in outer darkness.</p>
 <p>But, within a while, his variable mind caught a new impression,</p>
 <p>A new impression of the good old stamp, that sealed him when a child:</p>
 <p>He was softened, and abjured his infidelity; he was wiser, and despised his credulity;</p>
 <p>And turned again to simple faith more simply than before.</p>
 <p>Experience had declared too well his mind was built of water,</p>
 <p>And so, renouncing strength in self, he fixed his faith in God.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not for me to stipulate for creeds; Bible, Church, and Reason,</p>
 <p>These three shall lead the mind, if any can, to truth.</p>
 <p>But I must stipulate for faith: both God and man demand it:</p>
 <p>Trust is great in either world, if any would be well.</p>
 <p>Verily, the sceptical propensity is an universal foe;</p>
 <p>Sneering Pyrrho never found, nor cared to find, a friend:</p>
 <p>How could he trust another? and himself, whom would he not deceive?</p>
 <p>His proper gains were all his aim, and interests clash with kindness.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">{338}</a></span>
 <p>So, the Bedouin goeth armed, an enemy to all,</p>
 <p>The spear is stuck beside his couch, the dagger hid beneath his pillow.</p>
 <p>For society, void of mutual trust, of credit, and of faith,</p>
 <p>Would fall asunder as a waterspout, snapped from the cloud's attraction.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Faith</span> may rise into miracles of might, as some few wise have shown:</p>
 <p>Faith may sink into credulities of weakness, as the mass of fools have witnessed.</p>
 <p>Therefore, in the first, saints and martyrs have fulfilled their mission,</p>
 <p>Conquering dangers, courting deaths, and triumphing in all.</p>
 <p>Therefore, in the last, the magician and the witch, victims of their own delusion,</p>
 <p>Have gained the bitter wages of impracticable sins.</p>
 <p>They believed in allegiance with Satan; they worked in that belief,</p>
 <p>And thereby earned the loss and harm of guilt that might not be.</p>
 <p>For, faith hath two hands; with the one it addeth virtue to indifferents;</p>
 <p>Yea, it sanctified a Judith and a Jael, for what otherwise were treachery and murder:</p>
 <p>With the other hand it heapeth crime even on impossibles or simples,</p>
 <p>And many a wizard well deserved the faggot for his faith:</p>
 <p>He trusted in his intercourse with evil, he sacrificed heartily to fiends,</p>
 <p>He withered up with curses to the limit of his will, and was vile, because he thought himself a villain.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">A great</span> mind is ready to believe, for he hungereth to feed on facts,</p>
 <p>And the gnawing stomach of his ignorance craveth unceasing to be filled:</p>
 <p>A little mind is boastful and incredulous, for he fancieth all knowledge is his own,</p>
 <p>So will he cavil at a truth; how should it be true, and he not know it?&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">{339}</a></span>
 <p>There is an easy scheme, to solve all riddles by the sensual,</p>
 <p>And thus, despising mysteries, to feel the more sufficient;</p>
 <p>For it comforteth the foul hard heart, to reject the pure unseen,</p>
 <p>And relieveth the dull soft head, to hinder one from gazing upon vacancy.</p>
 <p>True wisdom, labouring to expound, heareth others readily;</p>
 <p>False wisdom, sturdy to deny, closeth up her mind to argument.</p>
 <p>The sum of certainties is found so small, their field so wide an universe,</p>
 <p>That many things may truly be, which man hath not conceived:</p>
 <p>The characters revealed of God are a strong mind's sole assurance</p>
 <p>That any strangeness may not stand a sober theme for faith.</p>
 <p>Ignorance being light denied, this ought to show the stronger in its view,</p>
 <p>But ignorance is commonly a double negative, both of light and morals:</p>
 <p>So, adding vanity to blindness, for ease, it taketh refuge in a doubt,</p>
 <p>And aching soon with ceaseless doubt, it finisheth the strife by misbelieving.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Faith,</span> by its very nature, shall embrace both credence and obedience:</p>
 <p>Yea, the word for both is one, and cannot be divided.</p>
 <p>For, work void of faith, wherein can it be counted for a duty;</p>
 <p>And faith not seen in work,&mdash;whereby can the doctrine be discovered?</p>
 <p>Faith in religion is an instrument; a handle, and the hand to turn it:</p>
 <p>Less a condition than a mean, and more an operation than a virtue.</p>
 <p>A moral sickness, like to sin, must have a moral cure;</p>
 <p>And faith alone can heal the mind, whose malady is sense.</p>
 <p>Ye are told of God's deep love: they that believe will love Him:</p>
 <p>They that love Him, will obey: and obedience hath its blessing.</p>
 <p>Ye are taught of the soul's great price; they that believe will prize it,</p>
 <p>And, prizing soul, will cherish well the hopes that make it happy.</p>
 <p>Effects spring from feelings; and feelings grow of faith:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">{340}</a></span>
 <p>If a man conceive himself insulted, will not his anger smite?</p>
 <p>Thus, let a soul believe his state, his danger, destiny, redemption,</p>
 <p>Will he not feel eager to be safe, like him that kept the prison at Philippi?</p>

 <p>And on one sunny morn, when all around was comfort,</p>

<div class="stanza">
 <p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">All</span>
 is vanity that is not honesty;&mdash;thus is it graven on the tomb:</p>
 <p>And there is no wisdom but in piety;&mdash;so the dead man preacheth:</p>
 <p>For, in a simple village church, among those classic shades</p>
 <p>Which sylvan Evelyn loved to rear, (his praise, and my delight,)</p>
 <p>These, the words of truth, are writ upon his sepulchre</p>
 <p>Who learnt much lore, and knew all trees, from the cedar to the hyssop on the wall.</p>
 <p>A just conjunction, godliness and honesty; ministering to both worlds,</p>
 <p>Well wed, and ill to be divided, a pair that God hath joined together.</p>
 <p>I touch not now the vulgar thought, as of tricks and cheateries in trade;</p>
 <p>I speak of honest purpose, character, speech and action.</p>
 <p>For an honest man hath special need of charity, and prudence,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">{342}</a></span>
 <p>Of a deep and humbling self-acquaintance, and of blessed commerce with his God,</p>
 <p>So that the keennesses of truth may be freed from asperities of censure,</p>
 <p>And the just but vacillating mind be not made the pendulum of arguments:</p>
 <p>For a false reason, shrewdly put, can often not be answered on the instant,</p>
 <p>And prudence looketh unto faith, content to wait solutions;</p>
 <p>Yea, it looketh, yea, it waiteth, still holding honesty in leash,</p>
 <p>Lest, as a hot young hound, it track not game, but vermin.</p>
 <p>Many a man of honest heart, but ignorant of self and God,</p>
 <p>Hath followed the marsh-fires of pestilence, esteeming them the lights of truth;</p>
 <p>He heard a cause, which he had not skill to solve,&mdash;and so received it gladly;</p>
 <p>And that cause brought its consequence, of harm to an unstable soul.</p>
 <p>Prudence, for a man's own sake, never should be separate from honesty;</p>
 <p>And charity, for other's good, and his, must still be joined therewith:</p>
 <p>For the harshly chiding tongue hath neither pleasuring nor profit,</p>
 <p>And the cold unsympathizing heart never gained a good.</p>
 <p>Sin is a sore, and folly is a fever; touch them tenderly for healing;</p>
 <p>The bad chirurgeon's awkward knife harmeth, spite of honesty.</p>
 <p>Still, a rough diamond is better than the polished paste,&mdash;</p>
 <p>That courteous flattering fool, who spake of vice as virtue:</p>
 <p>And honesty, even by itself, though making many adversaries</p>
 <p>Whom prudence might have set aside, or charity have softened,</p>
 <p>Evermore will prosper at the last, and gain a man great honour</p>
 <p>By giving others many goods, to his own cost and hindrance.</p>

 <p>What should make such an one ashamed? where courtiers kneel, he standeth;&mdash;</p>
 <p>I will indeed bow before the king, but knees were knit for God.</p>
 <p>And many such there be, of a high and noble conscience,</p>

 <p>He hath lost his own esteem, and other men's respect;</p>
 <p>For the buoyancy of upright faith, he is clothed in the heaviness of cringing;</p>
 <p>For plain truth where none could err, he hath chosen tortuous paths;</p>

 <p>Who can be altogether honest,&mdash;dragging out the secresies of life,</p>
 <p>And risking to be lashed and loathed for each unkind disclosure?</p>
 <p>Who can be altogether honest,&mdash;living in perpetual contentions,</p>
 <p>And prying out the petty cheats that swell the social scheme?</p>
 <p>For he must speak his instant mind,&mdash;a mind corrupt and sinful,</p>
 <p>Exhibiting to other men's disgust its undisguised deformities:</p>
 <p>He must utter all the hatred of his heart, and add to it the venom of his tongue;</p>
 <p>Shall he feel, and hide his feelings? that were the meanness of a hypocrite:&mdash;</p>
 <p>Still, O man, such hypocrisy is better, than this bold honesty to sin:</p>
 <p>Kill the feeling, or conceal it: let shame at least do the work of charity.</p>

 <p>That lantern is not lit to gaze on all the hatefulness of evil,</p>
 <p>But set on high for life and light, the loveliness of good.</p>
 <p>The hard censorious mind sitteth as a keen anatomist</p>
 <p>Tracking up the fibres in corruption, and prying on a fearful corpse:</p>
 <p>But the charitable soul is a young lover, enamoured little wisely,</p>
 <p>That saw no fault in her he loved, and sought to see one less;</p>

 <p>While seeming zeal, and its effort to do good, is only feigned self-praise:</p>
 <p>Often will the meannesses of life, hidden away in corners,</p>
 <p>Prove wisdom; and the generous is glad to leave them unregarded in the shade.</p>
 <p>The follies none are found to praise, let them die unblamed;</p>

 <p>Ever, in the practice of a man, will be seen both policy and privilege.</p>
 <p>Thank God, ye toilers for your bread, in that, daily labouring,</p>
 <p>He hath suffered the bubbles of self-interest to float upon the stream of duty:</p>
 <p>For honesty, of every kind, approved by God and man,</p>
 <p>Of wealth and better weal is found the richest cornucopia.</p>
 <p>Tempered by humbleness and charity, honesty of speech hath honour;</p>
 <p>And mingled well with prudence, honesty of purpose hath its praise:</p>
 <p>Trust payeth homage unto truth, rewarding honesty of action:</p>
 <p>And all men love to lean on him, who never failed nor fainted.</p>
 <p>Freedom gloweth in his eyes, and Nobleness of nature at his heart,</p>
 <p>And Independence took a crown and fixed it on his head:</p>
 <p>So, he stood in his integrity, just and firm of purpose,</p>
 <p>Aiding many, fearing none, a spectacle to angels, and to men:</p>
 <p>Yea,&mdash;when the shattered globe shall rock in the throes of dissolution,</p>
 <p>Still, will he stand in his integrity, sublime&mdash;an honest man.</p>

 <p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Better</span>
 is the mass of men, Suspicion, than thy fears,</p>
 <p>Kinder than thy thoughts, O chilling heart of Prudence,</p>
 <p>Purer than thy judgments, ascetic tongue of Censure,</p>
 <p>In all things worthier to love, if not also wiser to esteem.</p>
 <p>Yea, let the moralist condemn, there be large extenuations of his verdict,</p>
 <p>Let the misanthrope shun men and abjure, the most are rather loveable than hateful.</p>
 <p>How many pleasant faces shed their light on every side,</p>
 <p>How many angels unawares have crossed thy casual way!</p>
 <p>How often, in thy journeyings, hast thou made thee instant friends,</p>
 <p>Found, to be loved a little while, and lost, to meet no more;</p>
 <p>Friends of happy reminiscence, although so transient in their converse,</p>
 <p>Liberal, cheerful, and sincere, a crowd of kindly traits.</p>
 <p>I have sped by land and sea, and mingled with much people,</p>
 <p>But never yet could find a spot, unsunned by human kindness;</p>
 <p>Some more, and some less,&mdash;but truly all can claim a little;</p>
 <p>And a man may travel through the world, and sow it thick with friendships.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">{349}</a></span>
 <p><span class="smcap">There</span> be indeed, to say it in all sorrow, bad apostate souls,</p>
 <p>Deserted of their ministering angels, and given up to liberty of sin,&mdash;</p>
 <p>And other some, the miserly and mean, whose eyes are keen and greedy,</p>
 <p>With stony hearts, and iron fists, to filch and scrape and clutch,&mdash;</p>
 <p>And others yet again, the coarse in mind, selfish, sensual, brutish,</p>
 <p>Seeming as incapable of softer thoughts, and dead to better deeds;</p>
 <p>Such, no lover of the good, no follower of the generous and gentle,</p>
 <p>Can nearer grow to love, than may consist with pity.</p>
 <p>Few verily are these among the mass, and cast in fouler moulds,</p>
 <p>Few and poor in friends, and well-deserving of their poverty:</p>
 <p>Yet, or ever thou hast harshly judged, and linked their presence to disgust,</p>
 <p>Consider well the thousand things that made them all they are.</p>
 <p>Thou hast not thought upon the causes, ranged in consecutive necessity,</p>
 <p>Which tended long to these effects, with sure constraining power.</p>
 <p>For each of those unlovely ones, if thou couldst hear his story,</p>
 <p>Hath much to urge of just excuse, at least as men count justice:</p>
 <p>Foolish education, thwarted opportunities, natural propensities unchecked,&mdash;</p>
 <p>Thus were they discouraged from all good, and pampered in their evil;</p>
 <p>And, if thou wilt apprehend them well, tenderly looking on temptations,</p>
 <p>Bearing the base indulgently, and liberally dealing with the froward,</p>
 <p>Thou shalt discern a few fair fruits even upon trees so withered,</p>
 <p>Thou shalt understand how some may praise, and some be found to love them.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Nevertheless</span> for these, my counsel is, Avoid them if thou canst;</p>
 <p>For the finer edges of thy virtues will be dulled by attrition with their vice.</p>
 <p>And there is an enemy within thee; either to palliate their sin,</p>
 <p>Until, for surface-sweetness, thou too art drawn adown the vortex;</p>
 <p>Or, even unto fatal pride, to glorify thy purity by contrast,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">{350}</a></span>
 <p>Until the publican and harlot stand nearer heaven than the Pharisee:</p>
 <p>Or daily strife against their ill, in subtleness may irritate thy soul,</p>
 <p>And in that struggle thou shall fail, even through infirmity of goodness;</p>
 <p>Or, callous by continuance of injuries, thou wilt cease to pardon,</p>
 <p>Cease to feel, and cease to care, a cold case-hardened man.</p>
 <p>Beware of their example,&mdash;and thine own; beware the hazards of the battle;</p>
 <p>But chiefly be thou ware of this, an unforgiving spirit.</p>
 <p>Many are the dangers and temptations compassing a bad man's presence;</p>
 <p>The upas hath a poisonous shade, and who would slumber there?</p>
 <p>Wherefore, avoid them if thou canst; only, under providence and duty,</p>
 <p>If thy lot be cast with Kedar, patiently and silently live to their rebuke.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">How</span> beautiful thy feet, and full of grace thy coming,</p>
 <p>O better kind companion, that art well for either world!</p>
 <p>There is an atmosphere of happiness floating round that man,</p>
 <p>Love is throned upon his heart, and light is found within his dwelling:</p>
 <p>His eyes are rayed with peacefulness, and wisdom waiteth on his tongue;</p>
 <p>Seek him out, cherish him well, walking in the halo of his influence:</p>
 <p>For he shall be fragrance to thy soul, as a garden of sweet lilies,</p>
 <p>Hedged and apart from the outer world, an island of the blest among the seas.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">There</span> is an outer world, and there is an inner centre;</p>
 <p>And many varying rings concentric round the self.</p>
 <p>For, first, about a man,&mdash;after his communion with Heaven,&mdash;</p>
 <p>Is found the helpmate even as himself, the wife of his vows and his affections:</p>
 <p>See then that ye love in faith, scorning petty jealousies,</p>
 <p>For Satan spoileth too much love, by souring it with doubts;</p>
 <p>See that intimacy die not to indifference, nor anxiety sink into moroseness,</p>
 <p>And tend ye well the mutual minds bound in a copartnership for life.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">{351}</a></span>
 <p><span class="smcap">Next</span> of those concentric circles, radiating widely in circumference,</p>
 <p>Wheel in wheel, and world in world,&mdash;come the band of children:</p>
 <p>A tender nest of soft young hearts, each to be separately studied,</p>
 <p>A curious eager flock of minds, to be severally tamed and tutored.</p>
 <p>And a man, blest with these, hath made his own society,</p>
 <p>He is independent of the world, hanging on his friends more loosely:</p>
 <p>For the little faces round his hearth are friends enow for him,</p>
 <p>If he seek others, it is for sake of these, and less for his own pleasure.</p>
 <p>What companionship so sweet, yea, who can teach so well</p>
 <p>As these pure budding intellects, and bright unsullied hearts?</p>
 <p>What voice so musical as theirs, what visions of elegance so comely,</p>
 <p>What thoughts and hopes and holy prayers, can others cause like these?</p>
 <p>If ye count society for pastime,&mdash;what happier recreation than a nurseling,</p>
 <p>Its winning ways, its prattling tongue, its innocence and mirth?</p>
 <p>If ye count society for good,&mdash;how fair a field is here,</p>
 <p>To guide these souls to God, and multiply thyself for heaven!</p>
 <p>And this sweet social commerce with thy children groweth as their growth,</p>
 <p>Unless thou fail of duty, or have weaned them by thine absence.</p>
 <p>Keep them near thee, rear them well, guide, correct, instruct them;</p>
 <p>And be the playmate of their games, the judge in their complainings.</p>
 <p>So shall the maiden and the youth love thee as their sympathizing friend,</p>
 <p>And bring their joys to share with thee, their sorrows for consoling:</p>
 <p>Yea, their inmost hopes shall yearn to thee for counsel,</p>
 <p>They will not hide their very loves, if thou hast won their trust;</p>
 <p>But, even as man and woman, shall they gladly seek their father,</p>
 <p>Feeling yet as children feel, though void of fear in honour:</p>
 <p>And thou shall be a Nestor in the camp, the just and good old man,</p>
 <p>Hearty still, though full of years, and held the friend of all;</p>
 <p>No secret shall be kept from thee; for if ill, thy wisdom may repair it;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">{352}</a></span>
 <p>If well, thy praise is precious; and they would not miss that prize.</p>
 <p>O the blessing of a home, where old and young mix kindly,</p>
 <p>The young unawed, the old unchilled, in unreserved communion!</p>
 <p>O that refuge from the world, when a stricken son or daughter</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">{353}</a></span>
 <p>May seek, with confidence of love, a father's hearth and heart;</p>
 <p>Sure of a welcome, though others cast them out; of kindness, though men scorn them;</p>
 <p>And finding there the last to blame, the earliest to commend.</p>
 <p>Come unto me, my son, if sin shall have tempted thee astray,</p>
 <p>I will not chide thee like the rest, but help thee to return;</p>
 <p>Come unto me, my son, if men rebuke and mock thee,</p>
 <p>There always shall be one to bless,&mdash;for I am on thy side!</p>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Alas</span>,&mdash;and bitter is their loss, the parents, and the children,</p>
 <p>Who, loving up and down the world, have missed each other's friendship.</p>
 <p>Haply, it had grown of careless life, for years go swiftly by;</p>
 <p>Or sprang of too much carefulness, that drank up all the streams:</p>
 <p>Haply, sullen disappointment came and quenched the fire;</p>
 <p>Haply, sternness, or misrule, crushed or warped the feelings.</p>
 <p>Then, ill-combined in tempers, they learnt not each the other;</p>
 <p>The growing child grew out of love, and drew the breath of fear;</p>
 <p>The youth, ill-trained, renounced his fears, and made a league with cunning;</p>
 <p>And so those hardened men were foes, that should have been chief friends.</p>
 <p>Where was the cause, the mutual cause? O hunt it out to kill it:</p>
 <p>And what the cure, the simple cure?&mdash;A mutual flash of love.</p>
 <p>For dull estrangement's daily air froze up those early sympathies</p>
 <p>By cold continuance in apathy, or cutting winds of censure;</p>
 <p>It was a slow process, which any fleeting hour could have melted;</p>
 <p>But every hour duly came, and passed without the sun.</p>
 <p>Caution, care, and dry distrust, obscured each other's minds,</p>
 <p>Till both those gardens, rich to yield, were rank with many weeds:</p>
 <p>And doubt, a hidden worm, gnawed at the root of their Society,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">{354}</a></span>
 <p>They lacked of mutual confidence, and lived in mutual dread.</p>
 <p>Judge me, many fathers; and hearken to my counsel, many sons;</p>
 <p>I come with good in either hand, to reconcile contentions;</p>
 <p>For better friends can no man have, than those whom God hath given,</p>
 <p>And he that hath despised the gift, thought ill of that he knew not.</p>
 <p>Be ye wiser,&mdash;(I speak unto the sons,)&mdash;and win paternal friendships,</p>
 <p>Cultivate their kindness, seek them out with honour, and be the screening Japhet to their failings:</p>
 <p>And be ye wiser,&mdash;(I speak unto the fathers)&mdash;gain those filial comrades,</p>
 <p>Cherish their reasonable converse, and look not with coldness on your children.</p>
 <p>For the friendship of a child is the brightest gem set upon the circlet of Society,</p>
 <p>A jewel worth a world of pains&mdash;a jewel seldom seen.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">The</span> third cycle on the waters, another of those rings upon the onyx,</p>
 <p>A further definite broad zone, holdeth kith and kin:</p>
 <p>A motley band of many tribes, and under various banners;</p>
 <p>The intimate and strangers, the known and loved, or only seen for loathing:</p>
 <p>Some, dear for their deserts, shall honour and have honour of relationship,</p>
 <p>Some, despising duties, will add to it both burden and disgrace.</p>
 <p>A man's nearest kin are oftentimes far other than his dearest,</p>
 <p>Yet in the season of affliction those will haste to help him.</p>
 <p>For, note thou this, the providence of God hath bound up families together,</p>
 <p>To mutual aid and patient trial; yea, those ties are strong.</p>
 <p>Friends are ever dearer in thy wealth, but relations to be trusted in thy need,</p>
 <p>For these are God's appointed way, and those the choice of man:</p>
 <p>There is lower warmth in kin, but smaller truth in friends,</p>
 <p>The latter show more surface, and the first have more of depth:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">{355}</a></span>
 <p>Relations rally to the rescue, even in estrangement and neglect,</p>
 <p>Where friends will have fled at thy defeat, even after promises and kindness;</p>
 <p>For friends come and go, the whim that bound may loose them,</p>
 <p>But none can dissever a relationship, and Fate hath tied the knot.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Wide,</span> and edged with shadowy bounds, a distant boulevard to the city,</p>
 <p>The common crowd of social life is buzzing round about:</p>
 <p>That is as the outer court, with all defences levelled,</p>
 <p>Ranged around a man's own fortress, and his father's house.</p>
 <p>For many friends go in and out, and praise thee, finding pasture,</p>
 <p>And some are honeycomb to-day, who turn to gall to-morrow:</p>
 <p>And many a garrulous acquaintance with his frequent visit</p>
 <p>Will spend his leisure to thy cost, selling dulness dearly:</p>
 <p>For the idle call is a heavy tax, where time is counted gold,</p>
 <p>And even in the day of relaxation, haply he may spare his presence,&mdash;</p>
 <p>He found himself alone, and came to talk,&mdash;till they that hear are tired;</p>

 <p><span class="smcap">But</span> many friends there be, both well and wisely greeted,</p>

 <p>Of such are the early recollections, school friendships that have thriven to grey hairs,</p>
 <p>And veteran men are young once more, and talk of boyish pranks:</p>
 <p>And such, yet older on the list, are those who loved thy father,</p>
 <p>Thy father's friend, and thine, who tendereth thee tried love:</p>
 <p>Such also, many gentle hearts, whom thou hast known too lately,</p>
 <p>Hastening now to learn their worth, and chary of those minutes:</p>

 <p>And flocking pigeons come in clouds, and bend the groaning branches;</p>
 <p>Here for a rest, then off and away,&mdash;they have sped to other climes,</p>
 <p>And leave me to my peace once more, a holiday from thoughts.</p>
 <p>I dare not lure them back, for the mighty subject of Society</p>
 <p>Would tempt to many a hackneyed note in many a weary key:</p>
 <p>Sage warnings, stout advice, experiences ever to be learned,</p>
 <p>The foolish floatiness of vanity, and solemn trumperies of pride,&mdash;</p>
 <p>Economy, the poor man's mint,&mdash;extravagance, the rich man's pitfall,</p>
 <p>Harmful copings with the better, and empty-headed apings of the worse,</p>
 <p>Circumstance and custom, sympathies, antipathies, diverse kinds of conversation,</p>
 <p>Vapid pleasures, the weariness of gaiety, the strife and bustle of the world,</p>
 <p>Home comforts, the miseries of style, the cobweb lines of etiquette,</p>
 <p>The hollowness of courtesies, and substance of deceits,&mdash;idleness, business, and pastime,&mdash;</p>
 <p>The multitude of matters to be done, the when, and where, and how,</p>
 <p>And varying shades of character, to do, undo, or miss them,&mdash;</p>
 <p>All these, and many more alike, thick converging fancies,</p>
 <p>Flit in throngs about my theme, as honey-bees at even to their hive.</p>
 <p>Find an end, or make one: these seeds are dragon's teeth:</p>
 <p>Sown thoughts grow to things, and fill that field, the world:</p>
 <p>Many wise have gone before, and used the sickle well;</p>
 <p>Who can find a corner now, where none have bound the sheaves?</p>
 <p>So, other some may reap: I do but glean and gather:</p>
 <p>My sorry handful hath been culled after the ripe harvest of Society.</p>

 <p>Even he, whose hidden glance hath watched his deepest Solitude.</p>
 <p>For we walk the world in domino, putting on characters and habits,</p>
 <p>And wear a social Janus mask, while others stand around:</p>
 <p>I speak not of the hypocrite, nor dream of meant deceptions,</p>

<div class="stanza">

 <p>Yea, let a dog be watching thee, its eye will tend to thy restraint:</p>
 <p>Self-possession cannot be so perfect, with another intellect beside thee,</p>
 <p>It is not as a natural result, but rather the educated produce:</p>
 <p>The presence of a second spirit must control thine own,</p>
 <p>And throw it off its equipoise of peace, to balance by an effort.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">{358}</a></span>
 <p>The common minds of common men know of this but little;</p>

 <p>The sense that some are watching near, bindeth thee to caution;</p>
 <p>And the tree of tender nerves shrinketh as a touched mimosa,</p>
 <p>Drooping like a plant in drought, with half its strength decayed.</p>
 <p>There are antipathies warning from the many, and sympathies drawing to the few,</p>
 <p>But merchant-minds have crushed the first, and cannot feel the latter:</p>
 <p>Whereas to the quickened apprehension of a keen and spiritual intellect,</p>
 <p>Antipathies are galling, and sympathies oppress, and solitude is quiet.</p>

 <p>And there is an apparent generosity, when a man mixeth freely with his fellows;</p>
 <p>But prove his mind, by day and night, his thoughts are all of self:</p>
 <p>The world, inciting him to pleasures, or relentlessly provoking him to toil,</p>
 <p>Is full of anxious rivals, each with a difference of interest;</p>
 <p>So must he plan and practise for himself, even as his own best friend;</p>

 <p>God and the soul, these are his excuse, a just excuse, for solitude:</p>

 <p>The very flashing of his sword scattereth those shadowy foes;</p>
 <p>Confident and sanguine of success, he goeth forth conquering and to conquer.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Every</span> middle is burdened with a weariness,&mdash;to have to go as far again,&mdash;</p>
 <p>And Diligence is sick at heart, and Enterprise foot-sore:</p>
 <p>That which began in zeal, bursting as a fresh-dug spring,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">{363}</a></span>
 <p>Goeth on doggedly in toil, and hath no help of nature:</p>
 <p>Then, is need of moral might, to wrestle with the animal re-action,</p>
 <p>Still to fight, with few men left, and still though faint pursuing.</p>
 <p>The middle is a marshy flat, whereon the wheels go heavily,</p>
 <p>With clouds of doubt above, and ruts of discouragement below:</p>
 <p>Press on, sturdy traveller, yet a league, and yet a league!</p>
 <p>While every step is binding wings on thy victorious feet.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Every</span> end is happiness, the glorious consummation of design,</p>
 <p>The perils past, the fears annulled, the journey at its close:</p>
 <p>And the traveller resteth in complacency, home-returned at last:</p>
 <p>Work done may claim its wages, the goal gained hath won its prize:</p>
 <p>While the labour lasted, while the race was running,</p>
 <p>Many-times the sinews ached, and half refused the struggle:</p>
 <p>But now, all is quietness, a pleasant hour given to repose;</p>
 <p>Calmness in the retrospect of good, and calmness in the prospect of a blessing.</p>
 <p>Hope was glad in the beginning, and fear was sad midway,</p>
 <p>But sweet fruition cometh in the end, a harvest safe and sure.</p>
 <p>That which is, can never not have been: facts are solid as the pyramids:</p>
 <p>A thing done is written in the rock, yea, with a pen of iron.</p>
 <p>Uncertainty no more can scare, the proof is seen complete,</p>
 <p>Nor accident render unaccomplished, for the deed is finished.</p>
 <p>Thus the end shall crown the work, with grace, grace, unto the top-stone,</p>
 <p>And the work shall triumph in its crown, with peace, peace, unto the builder.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">I have</span> written, as other some of old, in quaint and meaning phrase,</p>
 <p>Of many things for either world, a crowd of facts and fancies:</p>
 <p>And will ye judge me, men of mind?&mdash;judge in kindly calmness;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">{364}</a></span>
 <p>For bitter words of haste or hate have often been repented.</p>
 <p>Deep dreaming upon surface reading; imagery crowded over argument;</p>
 <p>Order less considered in the multitude of thoughts: this witnessing is just.</p>
 <p>Scripture gave the holier themes, the well-turned words and wisdom;</p>
 <p>While Fancy on her swallow's wing skimmed those deeper waters.</p>
 <p>And wilt thou say with shrewdness,&mdash;He hath burnished up old truths,</p>
 <p>But where he seemed to fashion new, the novelty was false?</p>
 <p>Alas, for us in these last days, our elders reaped the harvest:</p>
 <p>Alas, for all men in all times, who glean so many tares!</p>
 <p>That which is true, how should it be new? for time is old in years:</p>
 <p>That which is new, how should it be true? for I am young in wisdom:</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, I have spoken at my best, according to the mercies given me,</p>
 <p>Of high, and deep, and famous things, of Evil, or of Good.</p>
 <p>I have told of Errors near akin to Truth, and wholesomes linked with poison;</p>
 <p>Of subtle Uses in the humblest, and the deep laid plots of Pride:</p>
 <p>I have praised Wisdom, comforted thy Hope, and proved to thee the folly of Complainings;</p>
 <p>Hinted at the hazard of an Influence, and turned thee from the terrors of Ambition.</p>
 <p>I have shown thee thy captivity to Law: yet bade thee hide Humilities;</p>
 <p>I have lifted the curtains of Memory; and smoothed the soft pillow of Rest.</p>
 <p>Experience had his sober hour; and Character its keen appreciation;</p>
 <p>And holy Anger stood sublime, where Hatred fell condemned.</p>
 <p>Prayer spake the mind of God, even in His own good words:</p>
 <p>And Zeal, with kindness warmly mixt, allied him to Discretion.</p>
 <p>I taught thee that nothing is a Trifle, even to the laugh of Recreation;</p>
 <p>I led thee with the Train of Religion, to be dazzled at the name of the Triune.</p>
 <p>Thought confessed his unseen fears; and Speech declared his triumphs;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">{365}</a></span>
 <p>I sang the blessedness of books; and commended the prudence of a letter:</p>
 <p>Riches found their room, either unto honour&mdash;or despising:</p>
 <p>Inventions took their lower place, for all things come of God.</p>
 <p>I scorned Ridicule; nor would humble me for Praise; for I had gained Self-knowledge;</p>
 <p>And pleaded fervently for Brutes, who suffer for man's sin.</p>
 <p>Then, I rose to Friendship; and bathed in all the tenderness of Love;</p>
 <p>Knew the purity of Marriage; and blest the face of Children.</p>
 <p>And whereas, by petulance or pride, I had haply said some evil,</p>
 <p>Mine after-thought was Tolerance, to bear the faults of all:</p>
 <p>Many faults, ill to bear, bred the theme of Sorrow;</p>
 <p>Many virtues, dear to see, induced the gush of Joy.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Thus,</span> for awhile, as leaving thee in joy, was I loth to break that spell;</p>
 <p>I roamed to other things and thoughts, and fashioned other books.</p>
 <p>But in a season of reflection, after many days,</p>
 <p>A thought stood before me in its garment of the past,&mdash;and lo, a legion with it!</p>
 <p>They came in thronging bands,&mdash;I could not fight nor fly them,&mdash;</p>
 <p>And so they took me to their tent, the prisoner of thoughts.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Then,</span> I bade thee greet me well, and heed my cheerful counsels;</p>
 <p>For every day we have a Friend, who changeth not with time.</p>
 <p>Gladly did I speak of my commission, for I felt it graven on my heart,</p>
 <p>And could not hold my wiser peace, but magnified mine office.</p>
 <p>Mystery had left her echoes in my mind, and I discoursed her secret:</p>
 <p>And thence I turned aside to man, and judged him for his Gifts.</p>
 <p>Beauty, noble thesis, had a world of sweets to sing of,</p>
 <p>And dated all her praise from God, the birthday of the soul.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">{366}</a></span>
 <p>Thence grew Fame; and Flattery came like Agag;</p>
 <p>But this was as the nauseous dregs, of that inspiring cup:</p>
 <p>Forth from Flattery sprang in opposition harsh and dull Neglect;</p>
 <p>And kind Contentment's gentle face to smile away the sadness.</p>
 <p>Life, all buoyancy and light, and Death, that sullen silence,</p>
 <p>Sped the soul to Immortality, the final home of man.</p>
 <p>Then, in metaphysical review, passed a triple troop,</p>
 <p>Swift Ideas, sounding Names, and heavily armed Things:</p>
 <p>Faith spake of her achievements even among men her brethren;</p>
 <p>And Honesty, with open mouth, would vindicate himself:</p>
 <p>The retrospect of Social life had many truths to tell of,</p>
 <p>And then I left thee to thy Solitude, learning there of Wisdom.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
 <p><span class="smcap">Friend</span> and scholar, lover of the right, mine equal kind companion,&mdash;</p>
 <p>I prize indeed thy favour, and these sympathies are dear:</p>
 <p>Still, if thy heart be little with me, wot thou well, my brother,</p>
 <p>I canvass not the smiles of praise, nor dread the frowns of censure.</p>
 <p>Through many themes in many thoughts, have we held sweet converse;</p>
 <p>But God alone be praised for mind! He only is sufficient,</p>
 <p>And every thought in every theme by prayer had been established:</p>
 <p>Who then should fear the face of man, when God hath answered prayer?&mdash;</p>
 <p>I speak it not in arrogance of heart, but humbly as of justice,</p>
 <p>I think it not in vanity of soul, but tenderly, for gratitude,&mdash;</p>
 <p>God hath blest my mind, and taught it many truths:</p>
 <p>And I have echoed some to thee, in weakness, yet sincerely:</p>
 <p>Yea, though ignorance and error shall have marred those lessons of His teaching,</p>
 <p>I stand in mine own Master's praise, or fall to His reproof.</p>
 <p>If thou lovest, help me with thy blessing; if otherwise, mine shall be for thee;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">{367}</a></span>
 <p>If thou approvest, heed my words; if otherwise, in kindness be my teacher.</p>
 <p>Many mingled thoughts for self have warped my better aim;</p>
 <p>Many motives tempted still, to toil for pride or praise:</p>
 <p>Alas, I have loved pride and praise, like others worse or worthier;</p>
 <p>But hate and fear them now, as snakes that fastened on my hand:</p>
 <p>Scævola burnt both hand and crime; but Paul flung the viper on the fire:</p>
 <p>He shook it off, and felt no harm: so be it! I renounce them.</p>
 <p>Rebuke then, if thou wilt rebuke,&mdash;but neither hastily nor harshly;</p>
 <p>Or, if thou wilt commend, be it honestly, of right: I work for God and good.</p>
